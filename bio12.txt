                              FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005, recommends that children’s life at school
must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the
legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between
the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF
signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning
and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of
education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
     The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will
take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities
and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate
new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the
prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other
resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible
if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body
of knowledge.
     These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual
calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The
methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook
proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of
stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden
by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration
for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance
this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and
wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
    The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the
hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We
wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics,
Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor K. Muralidhar,
Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi for guiding the work of this committee.
Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook. We are grateful to their
principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations
which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel.
We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOK

 In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students. The
 National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing
 opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT
 has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning
 Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration
 in this exercise.

 Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:

   • Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class
   • Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject
   • Difficulty level
   • Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from
     teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning
   • Content, which is irrelevant in the present context


 This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above.

                                    PREFACE
Biology is the study of life in its entirety. The growth of biology as a natural science during
the last 1000 years is interesting from many points of view. One feature of this growth is
changing emphasis. Initially it was description of life forms. Identification, nomenclature,
classification of all recorded living forms enjoyed the attention of scientists for a long time.
Description of their habitats and (in the case of animals) their behaviour was included in
this study. In later years, the focus was physiology and internal morphology or anatomy.
Darwinian ideas of evolution by natural selection changed the perception completely. Classical
descriptive and clueless biology found a theoretical framework in the evolutionary theory of
Darwin.
      In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Physics and Chemistry were applied to Biology
and the new science of Biochemistry soon became the dominant face of biology. On one hand
Biochemistry was integrating with Physiology, becoming almost synonymous with it. On the
other hand it gave rise to Structural Biology (structure of biomacromolecules), originally called
Molecular Biology. The work of Bernal, Pauling, Watson and Crick, Hodgkins, Perutz and Kendrew,
Delbruck, Luria, Monod, Beadle and Tatum, Lederberg, Brenner, Benzer, Nirenberg, Khorana,
Mclintock, Sanger, Cohen, Boyer, Kornbergs (father and son), Leder, Chambon and scores of
others brought in and established a modern version of Molecular Biology dealing with life
processes at molecular level.
      Physics and Chemistry dominated public perception of science for a long time.
Daytoday life of man was influenced by developments in Physics, Chemistry and their respective
manufacturing industries. Slowly and steadily, Biology, not to be left behind, demonstrated
its utility for human welfare. Medical practice, especially diagnostics, green revolution and
the newly emerging biotechnology and its success stories made the presence of biology felt
by the common man. Patent laws brought biology into political domain and commercial value
of biology became obvious.
      For more than a century, classical and so-called reductionist biology fought artifical
battles. The fact is both are important. Ecology brought in synthesis of both approaches
and emphasised integrated understanding of biology. Form and process are both equally
important. Systems biology, using mathematical tools, is bringing about a modern synthesis
of both the aspects of Biology.
      The Class XI and XII textbooks in biology essentially were to reflect these threads of
biological thought. While the Class XI book dealt with morphology, taxonomy, molecular and
cellular aspects of physiology, the Class XII book deals with the physiological process of
reproduction in flowering plants and humans, the principles of inheritance, the nature of
genetic material and its function, the contributions of biology to human welfare, basic
principles of biotechnological processes and their applications and achievements. The
Class XII book also relates genes to evolution on one hand and presents ecological interactions,
behaviour of populations and ecosystems on the other. Most important, the guidelines under
NCF-2005 have been followed in letter and spirit. The total learning load has been reduced

considerably and themes like environmental issues, adolescent problems and reproductive
health have been dealt with in some detail. Studied together, the class XI and class XII
textbooks in Biology would enable the student to —
         (i) become familiar with the diversity of biological material.
        (ii) appreciate and believe in the Darwinian evolutionary process exhibited by the living
             world.
       (iii) understand the dynamic state of constituents of living bodies, i.e., metabolic
             basis of all physiological processes in plants, animals and microbes.
       (iv) realise the structure and function of genetic material in directing the inherited
             phenotype pattern as well as a mediator of evolutionary process.
        (v) appreciate the profound contributions of biology to human welfare.
       (vi) reflect on the physico-chemical basis of living processes and at the same time
             realise the limitation of reductionism in understanding behaviour of organisms.
      (vii) experience the humbling effect of this realisation that all living organisms are
             related to each other by virtue of shared genetic material.
     (viii) realise that biology is the story of the struggle of living organisms for existence
             and survival.
    One may notice a perceptible change in the writing style. Most of the chapters are written
in an easy dialogue style engaging the student constantly while some chapters are in the
form of critical comments on the subject matter. A number of questions have been provided
at the end of each chapter though answers to some may not be found in the text. Students
have to read supplementary material, upon advise from the teacher, to answer such questions.
    I am thankful to Professor Krishna Kumar, Director NCERT; Professor G. Ravindra, Joint
Director, NCERT and Professor Hukum Singh, Head, DESM, NCERT for constant support. I
must place on record my deep appreciation for Dr B.K. Tripathi, Reader, DESM, NCERT for
his relentless efforts as coordinator in bringing out the Biology textbook for both the
Class XI and XII. All the members of the development team, the experts and reviewers, and
the school teachers have contributed enormously in the preparation of this book. I thank
them all. I am indeed highly thankful to the members of monitoring committee constituted
by Ministry of Human Resource Development for their valuable observation that helped in
the improvement of the book at the final stage. The book is prepared keeping in mind the
guidelines of the NCF-2005 especially the emphasis on reducing the learning load. We hope that
the book would meet the expectations of all the stakeholders. All suggestions for further
improvement are always welcome.

                       Born in November 1904 in Jaipur (Rajasthan) Panchanan Maheshwari
                       rose to become one of the most distinguished botanists not only of India
                       but of the entire world. He moved to Allahabad for higher education
                       where he obtained his D.Sc. During his college days, he was inspired
                       by Dr W. Dudgeon, an American missionary teacher, to develop interest
                       in Botany and especially morphology. His teacher once expressed that
                       if his student progresses ahead of him, it will give him a great satisfaction.
                       These words encouraged Panchanan to enquire what he could do for
                       his teacher in return.
                            He worked on embryological aspects and popularised the use of
                       embryological characters in taxonomy. He established the Department
                       of Botany, University of Delhi as an important centre of research in
                       embryology and tissue culture. He also emphasised the need for initiation
                       of work on artificial culture of immature embryos. These days, tissue
                       culture has become a landmark in science. His work on test tube
PANCHANAN MAHESHWARI

    (1904-1966)
                            He was honoured with fellowship of Royal Society of London (FRS),
                       Indian National Science Academy and several other institutions of
                       excellence. He encouraged general education and made a significant
                       contribution to school education by his leadership in bringing out the
                       very first textbooks of Biology for Higher Secondary Schools published
                       by NCERT in 1964.

                                       Human beings have had an intimate relationship with
                                       flowers since time immemorial. Flowers are objects of

              of floriculture – what does it refer to?
                   To a biologist, flowers are morphological and embryological marvels
              and the sites of sexual reproduction. In earlier classes, you have read the
              various parts of a flower. Figure 1.1 will help you recall the parts of a
              typical flower. Can you name the two parts in a flower in which the two
              most important units of sexual reproduction develop?

              1.2 PRE- FERTILISATION: STRUCTURES AND EVENTS
              Much before the actual flower is seen on a plant, the decision that the plant
              is going to flower has taken place. Several hormonal and structural changes
              are initiated which lead to the differentiation and further development of
4             the floral primordium. Inflorescences are formed which bear the floral buds
              and then the flowers. In the flower the male and female reproductive
              structures, the androecium and the gynoecium differentiate and develop.
              You would recollect that the androecium consists of a whorl of stamens
              representing the male reproductive organ and the gynoecium represents
              the female reproductive organ.

SEXUAL
HUMANREPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS
       REPRODUCTION

1.2.1 Stamen, Microsporangium and Pollen Grain
Figure 1.2a shows the two parts of a typical stamen – the long and slender
stalk called the filament, and the terminal generally bilobed structure
called the anther. The proximal end of the filament
is attached to the thalamus or the petal of the flower.
The number and length of stamens are variable in
flowers of different species. If you were to collect a
stamen each from ten flowers (each from different
species) and arrange them on a slide, you would
be able to appreciate the large variation in size seen
in nature. Careful observation of each stamen
under a dissecting microscope and making neat
diagrams would elucidate the range in shape and
attachment of anthers in different flowers.
     A typical angiosperm anther is bilobed with
each lobe having two theca, i.e., they are dithecous
(Figure 1.2b). Often a longitudinal groove runs
lengthwise separating the theca. Let us
understand the various types of tissues and their
organisation in the transverse section of an anther
(Figure 1.3a). The bilobed nature of an anther is
very distinct in the transverse section of the anther.
The anther is a four-sided (tetragonal) structure
consisting of four microsporangia located at the                               (b)
corners, two in each lobe.
     The microsporangia develop further and                          (a)
become pollen sacs. They extend longitudinally
all through the length of an anther and are packed Figure 1.2 (a) A typical stamen;
with pollen grains.                                              (b) three– dimensional cut section
Structure of microsporangium: In a transverse                    of an anther
section, a typical microsporangium appears near
circular in outline. It is generally surrounded by four wall layers (Figure
1.3b)– the epidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum. The
outer three wall layers perform the function of protection and help in
dehiscence of anther to release the pollen. The innermost wall layer is
the tapetum. It nourishes the developing pollen grains. Cells of the
tapetum possess dense cytoplasm and generally have more than one
nucleus. Can you think of how tapetal cells could become bi-nucleate?
     When the anther is young, a group of compactly arranged homogenous                       5
cells called the sporogenous tissue occupies the centre of each
microsporangium.
Microsporogenesis : As the anther develops, the cells of the sporogenous
tissue undergo meiotic divisions to form microspore tetrads. What would
be the ploidy of the cells of the tetrad?

                           As each cell of the sporogenous tissue is capable of giving rise to a
                      microspore tetrad. Each one is a potential pollen or microspore mother
                      cell. The process of formation of microspores from a pollen mother cell (PMC)
                      through meiosis is called microsporogenesis. The microspores, as they
                      are formed, are arranged in a cluster of four cells–the microspore tetrad
                      (Figure 1.3a). As the anthers mature and dehydrate, the microspores
                      dissociate from each other and develop into pollen grains (Figure 1.3 b).
                      Inside each microsporangium several thousands of microspores or pollen
  6                   grains are formed that are released with the dehiscence of anther
                      (Figure 1.3c).
                      Pollen grain: The pollen grains represent the male gametophytes. If you
                      touch the opened anthers of Hibiscus or any other flower you would find
                      deposition of yellowish powdery pollen grains on your fingers. Sprinkle
                      these grains on a drop of water taken on a glass slide and observe under

a microscope. You will really be amazed at the variety of architecture –
sizes, shapes, colours, designs – seen on the pollen grains
from different species (Figure 1.4).
    Pollen grains are generally spherical measuring about
25-50 micrometers in diameter. It has a prominent two-layered
wall. The hard outer layer called the exine is made up of
sporopollenin which is one of the most resistant organic material
known. It can withstand high temperatures and strong acids
and alkali. No enzyme that degrades sporopollenin is so far
known. Pollen grain exine has prominent apertures called germ
pores where sporopollenin is absent. Pollen grains are well-
preserved as fossils because of the presence of sporopollenin.
The exine exhibits a fascinating array of patterns and designs.
Why do you think the exine should be hard? What is the
function of germ pore? The inner wall of the pollen grain is
called the intine. It is a thin and continuous layer made up of
cellulose and pectin. The cytoplasm of pollen grain is
surrounded by a plasma membrane. When the pollen grain is
mature it contains two cells, the vegetative cell and generative
cell (Figure 1.5b). The vegetative cell is bigger, has abundant
food reserve and a large irregularly shaped nucleus. The
generative cell is small and floats in the cytoplasm of the                         (b)

vegetative cell. It is spindle shaped with dense cytoplasm and    Figure 1.5 (a) Enlarged view of

a nucleus. In over 60 per cent of angiosperms, pollen grains      of a microspore maturing into a

gametes before pollen grains are shed (3-celled stage).                                        7
    Pollen grains of many species cause severe allergies and bronchial
afflictions in some people often leading to chronic respiratory
disorders– asthma, bronchitis, etc. It may be mentioned that Parthenium
or carrot grass that came into India as a contaminant with imported wheat,
has become ubiquitous in occurrence and causes pollen allergy.

                  Pollen grains are rich in nutrients. It has become a fashion in recent
              years to use pollen tablets as food supplements. In western countries, a
              large number of pollen products in the form of tablets and syrups are
              available in the market. Pollen consumption has been claimed to increase
              the performance of athletes and race horses (Figure 1.6).

                  When once they are shed, pollen grains have to land on the stigma
              before they lose viability if they have to bring about fertilisation. How long
              do you think the pollen grains retain viability? The period for which pollen
              grains remain viable is highly variable and to some extent depends on the
              prevailing temperature and humidity. In some cereals such as rice and
              wheat, pollen grains lose viability within 30 minutes of their release, and
              in some members of Rosaceae, Leguminoseae and Solanaceae, they
              maintain viability for months. You may have heard of storing semen/
              sperms of many animals including humans for artificial insemination. It
              is possible to store pollen grains of a large number of species for years in
              liquid nitrogen (-1960C). Such stored pollen can be used as pollen banks,
              similar to seed banks, in crop breeding programmes.

              1.2.2 The Pistil, Megasporangium (ovule) and Embryo sac
              The gynoecium represents the female reproductive part of the flower. The
              gynoecium may consist of a single pistil (monocarpellary) or may have
              more than one pistil (multicarpellary). When there are more than one,
              the pistils may be fused together (syncarpous) (Figure 1.7b) or may be
8
              free (apocarpous) (Figure 1.7c). Each pistil has three parts (Figure 1.7a),
              the stigma, style and ovary. The stigma serves as a landing platform
              for pollen grains. The style is the elongated slender part beneath the
              stigma. The basal bulged part of the pistil is the ovary. Inside the ovary
              is the ovarian cavity ((locule). The placenta is located inside the ovarian
              cavity. Recall the definition and types of placentation that you studied in

Class XI. Arising from the placenta are the megasporangia, commonly
called ovules. The number of ovules in an ovary may be one (wheat,
paddy, mango) to many (papaya, water melon, orchids).
The Megasporangium (Ovule) : Let us familiarise ourselves with the
structure of a typical angiosperm ovule (Figure 1.7d). The ovule is a small
structure attached to the placenta by means of a stalk called funicle.
The body of the ovule fuses with funicle in the region called hilum. Thus,
hilum represents the junction between ovule and funicle. Each ovule has
one or two protective envelopes called integuments. Integuments encircle
the nucellus except at the tip where a small opening called the micropyle
is organised. Opposite the micropylar end, is the chalaza, representing
the basal part of the ovule.
    Enclosed within the integuments is a mass of cells called the nucellus.
Cells of the nucellus have abundant reserve food materials. Located in the
                                                                                               9
nucellus is the embryo sac or female gametophyte. An ovule generally has
a single embryo sac formed from a megaspore.
Megasporogenesis : The process of formation of megaspores from the
megaspore mother cell is called megasporogenesis. Ovules generally
differentiate a single megaspore mother cell (MMC) in the micropylar region

                       importance of the MMC undergoing meiosis? Meiosis results in the
                       production of four megaspores (Figure 1.8a).

                       megaspores is functional while the other three degenerate. Only the
                       functional megaspore develops into the female gametophyte (embryo
                       sac). This method of embryo sac formation from a single megaspore is termed
                       monosporic development. What will be the ploidy of the cells of the nucellus,
                       MMC, the functional megaspore and female gametophyte?

    Let us study about the formation of the embryo sac in detail.
(Figure 1.8b). The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically
to form two nuclei which move to the opposite poles, forming the 2-
nucleate embryo sac. Two more sequential mitotic nuclear divisions
result in the formation of the 4-nucleate and later the 8-nucleate stages
of the embryo sac. It is of interest to note that these mitotic divisions are
strictly free nuclear, that is, nuclear divisions are not followed immediately
by cell wall formation. After the 8-nucleate stage, cell walls are laid down
leading to the organisation of the typical female gametophyte
or embryo sac. Observe the distribution of cells inside the embryo sac
(Figure 1.8b, c). Six of the eight nuclei are surrounded by cell walls and
organised into cells; the remaining two nuclei, called polar nuclei are
situated below the egg apparatus in the large central cell.
    There is a characteristic distribution of the cells within the embryo
sac. Three cells are grouped together at the micropylar end and constitute
the egg apparatus. The egg apparatus, in turn, consists of two synergids
and one egg cell. The synergids have special cellular thickenings at the
micropylar tip called filiform apparatus, which play an important role in
guiding the pollen tubes into the synergid. Three cells are at the chalazal
end and are called the antipodals. The large central cell, as mentioned
earlier, has two polar nuclei. Thus, a typical angiosperm embryo sac, at
maturity, though 8-nucleate is 7-celled.

1.2.3 Pollination
In the preceding sections you have learnt that the male and female gametes
in flowering plants are produced in the pollen grain and embryo sac,
respectively. As both types of gametes are non-motile, they have to be
brought together for fertilisation to occur. How is this achieved?
    Pollination is the mechanism to achieve this objective. Transfer
of pollen grains (shed from the anther) to the stigma of a pistil is
termed pollination. Flowering plants have evolved an amazing array
of adaptations to achieve pollination. They make use of external
agents to achieve pollination. Can you list the possible external
agents?
Kinds of Pollination : Depending on the source of pollen, pollination
can be divided into three types.
      Autogamy : In this type, pollination is achieved within the same
                                                                                 11

      flower. Transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the
      same flower (Figure 1.9a). In a normal flower which opens and
      exposes the anthers and the stigma, complete autogamy is rather
      rare. Autogamy in such flowers requires synchrony in pollen release
      and stigma receptivity and also, the anthers and the stigma should

                                                      lie close to each other so that self-pollination
                                                      can occur. Some plants such as Viola
                                                      (common pansy), Oxalis, and Commelina
                                                      produce two types of flowers –
                                                      chasmogamous flowers which are similar to
                                                      flowers of other species with exposed anthers
                                                      and stigma, and cleistogamous flowers which
                                                      do not open at all (Figure 1.9c). In such flowers,
                                                      the anthers and stigma lie close to each other.
                   (a)                                When anthers dehisce in the flower buds,
                                                      pollen grains come in contact with the stigma
                                                      to effect pollination. Thus, cleistogamous
                                                      flowers are invariably autogamous as there is
                                                      no chance of cross-pollen landing on the
                                                      stigma. Cleistogamous flowers produce

                                                      pollinators. Do you think that cleistogamy is
                                                      advantageous or disadvantageous to the

                                                      autogamy since the pollen grains come from
                                                      the same plant.

                                                      1.9b). This is the only type of pollination which
                                                      during pollination brings genetically different

       REPRODUCTION

     Pollination by wind is more common
amongst abiotic pollinations. Wind pollination
also requires that the pollen grains are light
and non-sticky so that they can be
transported in wind currents. They often
possess well-exposed stamens (so that the
pollens are easily dispersed into wind currents,
Figure 1.10) and large often-feathery stigma
to easily trap air-borne pollen grains. Wind-
pollinated flowers often have a single ovule in
each ovary and numerous flowers packed into
an inflorescence; a familiar example is the corn
cob – the tassels you see are nothing but the
stigma and style which wave in the wind to
trap pollen grains. Wind-pollination is quite
common in grasses.
     Pollination by water is quite rare in
flowering plants and is limited to about 30
genera, mostly monocotyledons. As against
this, you would recall that water is a regular
mode of transport for the male gametes among
the lower plant groups such as algae,
bryophytes and pteridophytes. It is believed,
particularly for some bryophytes and                 Figure 1.10 A wind-pollinated plant showing
                                                                   compact inflorecence and well-
pteridophytes, that their distribution is limited
                                                                   exposed stamens
because of the need for water for the transport
of male gametes and fertilisation. Some
examples of water pollinated plants are Vallisneria and Hydrilla which
grow in fresh water and several marine sea-grasses such as Zostera. Not
all aquatic plants use water for pollination. In a majority of aquatic plants
such as water hyacinth and water lily, the flowers emerge above the level
of water and are pollinated by insects or wind as in most of the land
plants. In Vallisneria, the female flower reach the surface of water by the
long stalk and the male flowers or pollen grains are released on to the
surface of water. They are carried passively by water currents (Figure
1.11a); some of them eventually reach the female flowers and the stigma.
In another group of water pollinated plants such as seagrasses, female
flowers remain submerged in water and the pollen grains are released
                                                                                             13
inside the water. Pollen grains in many such species are long, ribbon like
and they are carried passively inside the water; some of them reach the
stigma and achieve pollination. In most of the water-pollinated species,
pollen grains are protected from wetting by a mucilaginous covering.
     Both wind and water pollinated flowers are not very colourful and do
not produce nectar. What would be the reason for this?

plant – cannot complete their life cycles without each other. The moth
deposits its eggs in the locule of the ovary and the flower, in turn, gets
pollinated by the moth. The larvae of the moth come out of the eggs as
the seeds start developing.
    Why don’t you observe some flowers of the following plants (or any
others available to you): Cucumber, Mango, Peepal, Coriander, Papaya,
Onion, Lobia, Cotton, Tobacco, Rose, Lemon, Eucalyptus, Banana? Try to
find out which animals visit them and whether they could be
pollinators.You’ll have to patiently observe the flowers over a few days
and at different times of the day. You could also try to see whether there
is any correlation in the characteristics of a flower to the animal that
visits it. Carefully observe if any of the visitors come in contact with the
anthers and the stigma as only such visitors can bring about pollination.
Many insects may consume pollen or the nectar without bringing about
pollination. Such floral visitors are referred to as pollen/nectar robbers.
You may or may not be able to identify the pollinators, but you will surely
enjoy your efforts!

Outbreeding Devices : Majority of flowering plants produce hermaphrodite
flowers and pollen grains are likely to come in contact with the stigma of
the same flower. Continued self-pollination result in inbreeding depression.
Flowering plants have developed many devices to discourage self-
pollination and to encourage cross-pollination. In some species, pollen
release and stigma receptivity are not synchronised. Either the pollen is
released before the stigma becomes receptive or stigma becomes receptive
much before the release of pollen. In some other species, the anther and
stigma are placed at different positions so that the pollen cannot come in
contact with the stigma of the same flower. Both these devices prevent
autogamy. The third device to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility.
This is a genetic mechanism and prevents self-pollen (from the same flower
or other flowers of the same plant) from fertilising the ovules by inhibiting
pollen germination or pollen tube growth in the pistil. Another device to
prevent self-pollination is the production of unisexual flowers. If both male
and female flowers are present on the same plant such as castor and maize
(monoecious), it prevents autogamy but not geitonogamy. In several species
such as papaya, male and female flowers are present on different plants,
that is each plant is either male or female (dioecy). This condition prevents
both autogamy and geitonogamy.

Pollen-pistil Interaction : Pollination does not guarantee the transfer           15
of the right type of pollen (compatible pollen of the same species as the
stigma). Often, pollen of the wrong type, either from other species or from
the same plant (if it is self-incompatible), also land on the stigma. The
pistil has the ability to recognise the pollen, whether it is of the right type
(compatible) or of the wrong type (incompatible). If it is of the right type,
the pistil accepts the pollen and promotes post-pollination events that

                           leads to fertilisation. If the pollen is of the wrong type, the pistil rejects the
                           pollen by preventing pollen germination on the stigma or the pollen tube
                           growth in the style. The ability of the pistil to recognise the pollen followed
                           by its acceptance or rejection is the result of a continuous dialogue
                           between pollen grain and the pistil. This dialogue is mediated by chemical
                           components of the pollen interacting with those of the pistil. It is only in
16                         recent years that botanists have been able to identify some of the pollen
                           and pistil components and the interactions leading to the recognition,
                           followed by acceptance or rejection.
                               As mentioned earlier, following compatible pollination, the pollen grain
                           germinates on the stigma to produce a pollen tube through one of the
                           germ pores (Figure 1.12a). The contents of the pollen grain move into the

pollen tube. Pollen tube grows through the tissues of the stigma and
style and reaches the ovary (Figure 1.12b, c). You would recall that in
some plants, pollen grains are shed at two-celled condition (a vegetative
cell and a generative cell). In such plants, the generative cell divides and
forms the two male gametes during the growth of pollen tube in the stigma.
In plants which shed pollen in the three-celled condition, pollen tubes
carry the two male gametes from the beginning. Pollen tube, after reaching
the ovary, enters the ovule through the micropyle and then enters one of
the synergids through the filiform apparatus (Figure 1.12d, e). Many recent
studies have shown that filiform apparatus present at the micropylar part
of the synergids guides the entry of pollen tube. All these events–from
pollen deposition on the stigma until pollen tubes enter the ovule–are
together referred to as pollen-pistil interaction. As pointed out earlier,
pollen-pistil interaction is a dynamic process involving pollen recognition
followed by promotion or inhibition of the pollen. The knowledge gained
in this area would help the plant breeder in manipulating pollen-pistil
interaction, even in incompatible pollinations, to get desired hybrids.
    You can easily study pollen germination by dusting some pollen from
flowers such as pea, chickpea, Crotalaria, balsam and Vinca on a glass slide
containing a drop of sugar solution (about 10 per cent). After about 15–30
minutes, observe the slide under the low power lens of the microscope. You
are likely to see pollen tubes coming out of the pollen grains.
    A breeder is interested in crossing different species and often genera
to combine desirable characters to produce commercially ‘superior’
varieties. Artificial hybridisation is one of the major approaches of crop
improvement programme. In such crossing experiments it is important
to make sure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination
and the stigma is protected from contamination (from unwanted pollen).
This is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques.
    If the female parent bears bisexual flowers, removal of anthers from
the flower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps is
necessary. This step is referred to as emasculation. Emasculated flowers
have to be covered with a bag of suitable size, generally made up of butter
paper, to prevent contamination of its stigma with unwanted pollen. This
process is called bagging. When the stigma of bagged flower attains
receptivity, mature pollen grains collected from anthers of the male parent
are dusted on the stigma, and the flowers are rebagged, and the fruits         17
allowed to develop.
    If the female parent produces unisexual flowers, there is no need for
emasculation. The female flower buds are bagged before the flowers open.
When the stigma becomes receptive, pollination is carried out using the
desired pollen and the flower rebagged.

                       1.3 DOUBLE FERTILISATION
                       After entering one of the synergids, the pollen tube releases the two male
                       gametes into the cytoplasm of the synergid. One of the male gametes moves
                       towards the egg cell and fuses with its nucleus thus completing the
                       syngamy. This results in the formation of a diploid cell, the zygote. The
                       other male gamete moves towards the two polar nuclei located in the central
                       cell and fuses with them to produce a triploid primary endosperm nucleus
                       (PEN) (Figure 1.13a). As this involves the fusion of three haploid nuclei it
                       is termed triple fusion. Since two types of fusions, syngamy and triple
                       fusion take place in an embryo sac the phenomenon is termed double
                       fertilisation, an event unique to flowering plants. The central cell after
                       triple fusion becomes the primary endosperm cell (PEC) and develops
                       into the endosperm while the zygote develops into an embryo.

                       Following double fertilisation, events of endosperm and embryo
18                     development, maturation of ovule(s) into seed(s) and ovary into fruit, are

endosperm tissue. The cells of this tissue are filled with
reserve food materials and are used for the nutrition of
the developing embryo. In the most common type of
endosperm development, the PEN undergoes successive
nuclear divisions to give rise to free nuclei. This stage of
endosperm development is called free-nuclear endosperm.
Subsequently cell wall formation occurs and the
endosperm becomes cellular. The number of free nuclei
formed before cellularisation varies greatly. The coconut
water from tender coconut that you are familiar with, is
nothing but free-nuclear endosperm (made up of
thousands of nuclei) and the surrounding white kernel is
the cellular endosperm.
   Endosperm may either be completely consumed by the                     (a)
developing embryo (e.g., pea, groundnut, beans) before seed
maturation or it may persist in the mature seed (e.g. castor
and coconut) and be used up during seed germination. Split
open some seeds of castor, peas, beans, groundnut, fruit of
coconut and look for the endosperm in each case. Find out
whether the endosperm is persistent in cereals – wheat, rice
and maize.

1.4.2 Embryo
Embryo develops at the micropylar end of the embryo sac where
the zygote is situated. Most zygotes divide only after certain
amount of endosperm is formed. This is an adaptation to
provide assured nutrition to the developing embryo. Though
the seeds differ greatly, the early stages of embryo development
(embryogeny) are similar in both monocotyledons and
dicotyledons. Figure 1.13 depicts the stages of embryogeny in
a dicotyledonous embryo. The zygote gives rise to the
proembryo and subsequently to the globular, heart-shaped
and mature embryo.
                                                                      (b)
     A typical dicotyledonous embryo (Figure 1.14a), consists
of an embryonal axis and two cotyledons. The portion of Figure 1.14 (a) A typical dicot
embryonal axis above the level of cotyledons is the epicotyl,       embryo; (b) L.S. of an

which terminates with the plumule or stem tip. The cylindrical
portion below the level of cotyledons is hypocotyl that
terminates at its lower end in the radicle or root tip. The root                     19
tip is covered with a root cap.
     Embryos of monocotyledons (Figure 1.14 b) possess only
one cotyledon. In the grass family the cotyledon is called
scutellum that is situated towards one side (lateral) of the
embryonal axis. At its lower end, the embryonal axis has the

               radical and root cap enclosed in an undifferentiated sheath called
               coleorrhiza. The portion of the embryonal axis above the level of
               attachment of scutellum is the epicotyl. Epicotyl has a shoot apex and a
               few leaf primordia enclosed in a hollow foliar structure, the coleoptile.
                   Soak a few seeds in water (say of wheat, maize, peas, chickpeas,
               ground nut) overnight. Then split the seeds and observe the various
               parts of the embryo and the seed.

               1.4.3 Seed
               In angiosperms, the seed is the final product of sexual reproduction. It is
               often described as a fertilised ovule. Seeds are formed inside fruits. A
               seed typically consists of seed coat(s), cotyledon(s) and an embryo axis.
               The cotyledons (Figure 1.15a) of the embryo are simple structures,
               generally thick and swollen due to storage of food reserves (as in legumes).
               Mature seeds may be non-albuminous or ex-albuminous. Non-
               albuminous seeds have no residual endosperm as it is completely
               consumed during embryo development (e.g., pea, groundnut).
               Albuminous seeds retain a part of endosperm as it is not completely used
               up during embryo development (e.g., wheat, maize, barley, castor).
               Occasionally, in some seeds such as black pepper and beet, remnants of
               nucellus are also persistent. This residual, persistent nucellus is the
               perisperm.
                   Integuments of ovules harden as tough protective seed coats
               (Figure 1.15a). The micropyle remains as a small pore in the seed coat.
               This facilitates entry of oxygen and water into the seed during germination.
               As the seed matures, its water content is reduced and seeds become
               relatively dry (10-15 per cent moisture by mass). The general metabolic
               activity of the embryo slows down. The embryo may enter a state of
               inactivity called dormancy, or if favourable conditions are available
               (adequate moisture, oxygen and suitable temperature), they germinate.
                   As ovules mature into seeds, the ovary develops into a fruit, i.e., the
               transformation of ovules into seeds and ovary into fruit proceeds
               simultaneously. The wall of the ovary develops into the wall of fruit called
               pericarp. The fruits may be fleshy as in guava, orange, mango, etc., or
               may be dry, as in groundnut, and mustard, etc. Many fruits have evolved
               mechanisms for dispersal of seeds. Recall the classification of fruits and
               their dispersal mechanisms that you have studied in an earlier class. Is
               there any relationship between number of ovules in an ovary and the
20             number of seeds present in a fruit?
                   In most plants, by the time the fruit develops from the ovary, other
               floral parts degenerate and fall off. However, in a few species such as apple,
               strawberry, cashew, etc., the thalamus also contributes to fruit formation.
               Such fruits are called false fruits (Figure 1.15b). Most fruits however
               develop only from the ovary and are called true fruits. Although in most
               of the species, fruits are the results of fertilisation, there are a few species

    Seeds offer several advantages to angiosperms. Firstly, since
reproductive processes such as pollination and fertilisation are
independent of water, seed formation is more dependable. Also seeds have
better adaptive strategies for dispersal to new habitats and help the species

               to colonise in other areas. As they have sufficient food reserves, young
               seedlings are nourished until they are capable of photosynthesis on their
               own. The hard seed coat provides protection to the young embryo. Being
               products of sexual reproduction, they generate new genetic combinations
               leading to variations.
                   Seed is the basis of our agriculture. Dehydration and dormancy of
               mature seeds are crucial for storage of seeds which can be used as food
               throughout the year and also to raise crop in the next season. Can you
               imagine agriculture in the absence of seeds, or in the presence of seeds
               which germinate straight away soon after formation and cannot be stored?
                   How long do the seeds remain alive after they are dispersed? This
               period again varies greatly. In a few species the seeds lose viability within
               a few months. Seeds of a large number of species live for several years.
               Some seeds can remain alive for hundreds of years. There are several
               records of very old yet viable seeds. The oldest is that of a lupine, Lupinus
               arcticus excavated from Arctic Tundra. The seed germinated and flowered
               after an estimated record of 10,000 years of dormancy. A recent record of
               2000 years old viable seed is of the date palm, Phoenix dactylifera
               discovered during the archeological excavation at King Herod’s palace
               near the Dead Sea.
                   After completing a brief account of sexual reproduction of flowering
               plants it would be worth attempting to comprehend the enormous
               reproductive capacity of some flowering plants by asking the following
               questions: How many eggs are present in an embryo sac? How many
               embryo sacs are present in an ovule? How many ovules are present in
               an ovary? How many ovaries are present in a typical flower? How many
               flowers are present on a tree? And so on...
                   Can you think of some plants in which fruits contain very large
               number of seeds. Orchid fruits are one such category and each fruit
               contain thousands of tiny seeds. Similar is the case in fruits of some
               parasitic species such as Orobanche and Striga. Have you seen a tiny
               seed of Ficus? How large is the tree of Ficus developed from that tiny
               seed. How many billions of seeds does each Ficus tree produce? Can
               you imagine any other example in which such a tiny structure can
               produce such a large biomass over the years?

               1.5 APOMIXIS AND POLYEMBRYONY
               Although seeds, in general are the products of fertilisation, a few flowering
22             plants such as some species of Asteraceae and grasses, have evolved a
               special mechanism, to produce seeds without fertilisation, called apomixis.
               What is fruit production without fertilisation called? Thus, apomixis is a
               form of asexual reproduction that mimics sexual reproduction. There are
               several ways of development of apomictic seeds. In some species, the
               diploid egg cell is formed without reduction division and develops into
               the embryo without fertilisation. More often, as in many Citrus and Mango

varieties some of the nucellar cells surrounding the embryo sac start
dividing, protrude into the embryo sac and develop into the embryos. In
such species each ovule contains many embryos. Occurrence of more
than one embryo in a seed is referred to as polyembryony. Take out
some seeds of orange and squeeze them. Observe the many embryos of
different sizes and shapes from each seed. Count the number of embryos
in each seed. What would be the genetic nature of apomictic embryos?
Can they be called clones?
    Hybrid varieties of several of our food and vegetable crops are being
extensively cultivated. Cultivation of hybrids has tremendously increased
productivity. One of the problems of hybrids is that hybrid seeds have
to be produced every year. If the seeds collected from hybrids are sown,
the plants in the progeny will segregate and do not maintain hybrid
characters. Production of hybrid seeds is costly and hence the cost of
hybrid seeds become too expensive for the farmers. If these hybrids are
made into apomicts, there is no segregation of characters in the hybrid
progeny. Then the farmers can keep on using the hybrid seeds to raise
new crop year after year and he does not have to buy hybrid seeds every
year. Because of the importance of apomixis in hybrid seed industry,
active research is going on in many laboratories around the world to
understand the genetics of apomixis and to transfer apomictic genes
into hybrid varieties.



                                SUMMARY
  Flowers are the seat of sexual reproduction in angiosperms. In the flower,
  androecium consisting of stamens represents the male reproductive
  organs and gynoecium consisting of pistils represents the female
  reproductive organs.
      A typical anther is bilobed, dithecous and tetrasporangiate. Pollen
  grains develop inside the microsporangia. Four wall layers, the
  epidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum surround the
  microsporangium. Cells of the sporogenous tissue lying in the centre of
  the microsporangium, undergo meiosis (microsporogenesis) to form
  tetrads of microspores. Individual microspores mature into pollen grains.
      Pollen grains represents the male gametophytic generation. The
  pollen grains have a two-layered wall, the outer exine and inner intine.
  The exine is made up of sporopollenin and has germ pores. Pollen grains
  may have two cells (a vegetative cell and generative cell) or three cells (a
  vegetative cell and two male gametes) at the time of shedding.
      The pistil has three parts – the stigma, style and the ovary. Ovules       23
  are present in the ovary. The ovules have a stalk called funicle, protective
  integument(s), and an opening called micropyle. The central tissue is
  the nucellus in which the archesporium differentiates. A cell of the
  archesporium, the megaspore mother cell divides meiotically and one of
  the megaspores forms the embryo sac (the female gametophyte). The
  mature embryo sac is 7-celled and 8-nucleate. At the micropylar end is

                the egg apparatus consisting of two synergids and an egg cell. At the
                chalazal end are three antipodals. At the centre is a large central cell
                with two polar nuclei.
                    Pollination is the mechanism to transfer pollen grains from the
                anther to the stigma. Pollinating agents are either abiotic (wind and
                water) or biotic (animals).
                    Pollen-pistil interaction involves all events from the landing of pollen
                grains on the stigma until the pollen tube enters the embryo sac (when
                the pollen is compatible) or pollen inhibition (when the pollen is
                incompatible). Following compatible pollination, pollen grain germinates
                on the stigma and the resulting pollen tube grow through the style,
                enter the ovules and finally discharges two male gametes in one of the
                synergids. Angiosperms exhibit double fertilisation because two fusion
                events occur in each embryo sac, namely syngamy and triple fusion.
                The products of these fusions are the diploid zygote and the triploid
                primary endosperm nucleus (in the primary endosperm cell). Zygote
                develops into the embryo and the primary endosperm cell forms the
                endosperm tissue. Formation of endosperm always precedes
                development of the embryo.
                    The developing embryo passes through different stages such as
                the proembryo, globular and heart-shaped stages before maturation.
                Mature dicotyledonous embryo has two cotyledons and an embryonal
                axis with epicotyl and hypocotyl. Embryos of monocotyledons have a
                single cotyledon. After fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and ovules
                develop into seeds.
                    A phenomenon called apomixis is found in some angiosperms,
                particularly in grasses. It results in the formation of seeds without
                fertilisation. Apomicts have several advantages in horticulture and
                agriculture.
                    Some angiosperms produce more than one embryo in their seed.
                This phenomenon is called polyembryony.

                                   The male reproductive system is located in the pelvis region
                                   (Figure 2.1a). It includes a pair of testes alongwith
                                   accessory ducts, glands and the external genitalia.

     The testes are situated outside the
abdominal cavity within a pouch
called scrotum. The scrotum helps
in maintaining the low temperature
of the testes (2–2.5o C lower than
the normal internal body
temperature) necessary for
spermatogenesis. In adults, each
testis is oval in shape, with a length
of about 4 to 5 cm and a width of
about 2 to 3 cm. The testis is
covered by a dense covering. Each
testis has about 250 compartments

is lined on its inside by two types
of cells called male germ cells
(spermatogonia) and Sertoli cells
(Figure 2.2 ). The male germ cells
undergo meiotic divisions finally
leading to sperm formation, while
Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the
germ cells. The regions outside the
seminiferous tubules called
interstitial spaces, contain small
blood vessels and interstitial cells
or Leydig cells (Figure 2.2). Leydig
cells synthesise and secrete
testicular hormones called Figure 2.1(b) Diagrammatic view of male reproductive system

androgens. Other immunologically
competent cells are also present.
     The male sex accessory ducts include rete testis, vasa efferentia,
epididymis and vas deferens (Figure 2.1b). The seminiferous tubules of
the testis open into the vasa efferentia through rete testis. The vasa efferentia
leave the testis and open into epididymis located along the posterior surface                          27
of each testis. The epididymis leads to vas deferens that ascends to the
abdomen and loops over the urinary bladder. It receives a duct from seminal
vesicle and opens into urethra as the ejaculatory duct (Figure 2.1a). These
ducts store and transport the sperms from the testis to the outside through
urethra. The urethra originates from the urinary bladder and extends
through the penis to its external opening called urethral meatus.

               of special tissue that helps in erection of the penis to facilitate insemination.
               The enlarged end of penis called the glans penis is covered by a loose fold
               of skin called foreskin.
                   The male accessory glands (Figure 2.1a, b) include paired seminal
               vesicles, a prostate and paired bulbourethral glands. Secretions of these
               glands constitute the seminal plasma which is rich in fructose, calcium
               and certain enzymes. The secretions of bulbourethral glands also helps
               in the lubrication of the penis.

               2.2 THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM
               The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries alongwith a pair
               of oviducts, uterus, cervix, vagina and the external genitalia located in
               pelvic region (Figure 2.3a). These parts of the system alongwith a pair of the
               mammary glands are integrated structurally and functionally to support
               the processes of ovulation, fertilisation, pregnancy, birth and child care.
                   Ovaries are the primary female sex organs that produce the female
28             gamete (ovum) and several steroid hormones (ovarian hormones).
               The ovaries are located one on each side of the lower abdomen
               (Figure 2.3b). Each ovary is about 2 to 4 cm in length and is connected to
               the pelvic wall and uterus by ligaments. Each ovary is covered by a thin
               epithelium which encloses the ovarian stroma. The stroma is divided into
               two zones – a peripheral cortex and an inner medulla.

to the ovary is the funnel-shaped infundibulum. The edges of the

               part of the oviduct called ampulla. The last part of the oviduct, isthmus has
               a narrow lumen and it joins the uterus.
                    The uterus is single and it is also called womb. The shape of the uterus
               is like an inverted pear. It is supported by ligaments attached to the pelvic
               wall. The uterus opens into vagina through a narrow cervix. The cavity of
               the cervix is called cervical canal (Figure 2.3b) which alongwith vagina
               forms the birth canal. The wall of the uterus has three layers of tissue. The
               external thin membranous perimetrium, middle thick layer of smooth
               muscle, myometrium and inner glandular layer called endometrium that
               lines the uterine cavity. The endometrium undergoes cyclical changes during
               menstrual cycle while the myometrium exhibits strong contraction during
               delivery of the baby.
                    The female external genitalia include mons pubis, labia majora, labia
               minora, hymen and clitoris (Figure 2.3a). Mons pubis is a cushion of fatty
               tissue covered by skin and pubic hair. The labia majora are fleshy folds of
               tissue, which extend down from the mons pubis and surround the vaginal
               opening. The labia minora are paired folds of tissue under the labia majora.
               The opening of the vagina is often covered partially by a membrane called
               hymen. The clitoris is a tiny finger-like structure which lies at the upper
               junction of the two labia minora above the urethral opening. The hymen is
               often torn during the first coitus (intercourse). However, it can also be broken
               by a sudden fall or jolt, insertion of a vaginal tampon, active participation
               in some sports like horseback riding, cycling, etc. In some women the hymen
               persists even after coitus. In fact, the presence or absence of hymen is not
               a reliable indicator of virginity or sexual experience.

HUMAN REPRODUCTION


    A functional mammary gland is characteristic of all female mammals.
The mammary glands are paired structures (breasts) that contain
glandular tissue and variable amount of fat. The glandular tissue of each
breast is divided into 15-20 mammary lobes containing clusters of cells
called alveoli (Figure 2.4). The cells of alveoli secrete milk, which is stored
in the cavities (lumens) of alveoli. The alveoli open into mammary tubules.
The tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct. Several mammary
ducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla which is connected to
lactiferous duct through which milk is sucked out.

2.3 GAMETOGENESIS
The primary sex organs – the testis in the males and the ovaries in the
females – produce gametes, i.e, sperms and ovum, respectively, by the
process called gametogenesis. In testis, the immature male germ cells
(spermatogonia) produce sperms by spermatogenesis that begins at
puberty. The spermatogonia (sing. spermatogonium) present on the
inside wall of seminiferous tubules multiply by mitotic division and
increase in numbers. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46
chromosomes. Some of the spermatogonia called p r i m a r y
spermatocytes periodically undergo meiosis. A primary spermatocyte
completes the first meiotic division (reduction division) leading to
formation of two equal, haploid cells called
secondary spermatocytes, which have
only 23 chromosomes each. The secondary
spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic
division to produce four equal, haploid
spermatids (Figure 2.5). What would be the
number of chromosome in the spermatids?
The spermatids are transformed into
spermatozoa (sperms) by the process
called        s p e r m i o g e n e s i s. After
spermiogenesis, sperm heads become
embedded in the Sertoli cells, and are finally
released from the seminiferous tubules by
the process called spermiation.
    Spermatogenesis starts at the age of Figure 2.5 Diagrammatic sectional view of a
puberty due to significant increase in the                  seminiferous tubule (enlarged)
secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone
(GnRH). This, if you recall, is a hypothalamic hormone. The increased                      31
levels of GnRH then acts at the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates
secretion of two gonadotropins – luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH). LH acts at the Leydig cells and stimulates
synthesis and secretion of androgens. Androgens, in turn, stimulate the
process of spermatogenesis. FSH acts on the Sertoli cells and stimulates

                                               process of spermiogenesis.
                                                    Let us examine the structure of a sperm. It
                                               is a microscopic structure composed of a head,
                                               neck, a middle piece and a tail (Figure 2.6).
                                               A plasma membrane envelops the whole body
                                               of sperm. The sperm head contains an elongated
                                               haploid nucleus, the anterior portion of which
                                               is covered by a cap-like structure, acrosome.
                                               The acrosome is filled with enzymes that help
                                               fertilisation of the ovum. The middle piece
                                               possesses numerous mitochondria, which
                                               produce energy for the movement of tail that
                                               facilitate sperm motility essential for fertilisation.
                                               The human male ejaculates about 200 to 300
                                               million sperms during a coitus of which, for
                                               normal fertility, at least 60 per cent sperms
                                               must have normal shape and size and at least
                                               40 per cent of them must show vigorous
                                               motility.

                                                    Sperms released from the seminiferous
                                               tubules, are transported by the accessory
                   ducts. Secretions of epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle and
                   prostate are essential for maturation and motility of sperms. The seminal
                   plasma along with the sperms constitute the semen. The functions of
                   male sex accessory ducts and glands are maintained by the testicular
                   hormones (androgens).
                        The process of formation of a mature female gamete is called oogenesis
                   which is markedly different from spermatogenesis. Oogenesis is initiated
                   during the embryonic development stage when a couple of million gamete
                   mother cells (oogonia) are formed within each fetal ovary; no more oogonia
                   are formed and added after birth. These cells start division and enter into
                   prophase-I of the meiotic division and get temporarily arrested at that stage,
                   called primary oocytes. Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a
                   layer of granulosa cells and is called the primary follicle (Figure 2.7). A
                   large number of these follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to
                   puberty. Therefore, at puberty only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are
                   left in each ovary. The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of
                   granulosa cells and a new theca and are called secondary follicles.
                        The secondary follicle soon transforms into a tertiary follicle which is
32                 characterised by a fluid filled cavity called antrum. The theca layer is
                   organised into an inner theca interna and an outer theca externa. It is
                   important to draw your attention that it is at this stage that the primary
                   oocyte within the tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its first meiotic
                   division. It is an unequal division resulting in the formation of a large
                   haploid secondary oocyte and a tiny first polar body (Figure 2.8b). The

secondary oocyte retains bulk of the
nutrient rich cytoplasm of the primary
oocyte. Can you think of any advantage
for this? Does the first polar body born
out of first meiotic division divide further
or degenerate? At present we are not
very certain about this. The tertiary
follicle further changes into the mature
follicle or Graafian follicle (Figure 2.7).
The secondary oocyte forms a new
membrane called zona pellucida
surrounding it. The Graafian follicle now
ruptures to release the secondary oocyte
(ovum) from the ovary by the
process called ovulation. Can you            Figure 2.7 Diagrammatic Section view of ovary

The reproductive cycle in the female primates (e.g. monkeys, apes and
human beings) is called menstrual cycle. The first menstruation begins
at puberty and is called menarche. In human females, menstruation
is repeated at an average interval of about 28/29 days, and the cycle of
events starting from one menstruation till the next one is called the
menstrual cycle. One ovum is released (ovulation) during the middle

                    of each menstrual cycle. The major events of the menstrual cycle are
                    shown in Figure 2.9. The cycle starts with the menstrual phase, when
                    menstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days. The menstrual flow
                    results due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus and its
                    blood vessels which forms liquid that comes out through vagina.
                    Menstruation only occurs if the released ovum is not fertilised. Lack of
                    menstruation may be indicative of pregnancy. However, it may also be
                    caused due to some other underlying causes like stress, poor health etc.
34                  The menstrual phase is followed by the follicular phase. During
                    this phase, the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a
                    fully mature Graafian follicle and simultaneously the endometrium
                    of uterus regenerates through proliferation. These changes in the
                    ovary and the uterus are induced by changes in the levels of

2.5 FERTILISATION AND IMPLANTATION
During copulation (coitus) semen is released by the penis into the vagina
(insemination). The motile sperms swim rapidly, pass through the cervix,
enter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the
fallopian tube (Figure 2.11b). The ovum released by the ovary is also
transported to the ampullary region
where fertilisation takes place.
Fertilisation can only occur if the
ovum and sperms are transported
simultaneously to the ampullary
region. This is the reason why not all
copulations lead to fertilisation and
pregnancy.
     The process of fusion of a sperm
with an ovum is called fertilisation.
During fertilisation, a sperm comes in
contact with the zona pellucida layer
of the ovum (Figure 2.10) and induces
changes in the membrane that block
the entry of additional sperms. Thus,                                                         35 35
it ensures that only one sperm can
fertilise an ovum. The secretions of the
acrosome help the sperm enter into the
cytoplasm of the ovum through the
zona pellucida and the plasma

                       membrane. This induces the completion of the meiotic division of the
                       secondary oocyte. The second meiotic division is also unequal and results
                       in the formation of a second polar body and a haploid ovum (ootid). Soon
                       the haploid nucleus of the sperms and that of the ovum fuse together to
                       form a diploid zygote. How many chromosomes will be there in the zygote?
                           One has to remember that the sex of the baby has been decided at this
                       stage itself. Let us see how? As you know the chromosome pattern in the
                       human female is XX and that in the male is XY. Therefore, all the haploid
                       gametes (ova) produced by the female have the sex chromosome X whereas
                       in the male gametes (sperms) the sex chromosome could be either X or Y,
                       hence, 50 per cent of sperms carry the X chromosome while the other 50 per
                       cent carry the Y. After fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote
                       would carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X
                       or Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carrying XX would develop into a female
                       baby and XY would form a male (you will learn more about the chromosomal
                       patterns in Chapter 5). That is why, scientifically it is correct to say that the
                       sex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother!
                           The mitotic division starts as the zygote moves through the isthmus
                       of the oviduct called cleavage towards the uterus (Figure 2.11) and forms
                       2, 4, 8, 16 daughter cells called blastomeres. The embryo with 8 to 16

blastomeres is called a morula (Figure 2.11e). The morula continues to
divide and transforms into blastocyst (Figure 2.11g) as it moves further
into the uterus. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an
outer layer called trophoblast and an inner group of cells attached to
trophoblast called the inner cell mass. The trophoblast layer then gets
attached to the endometrium and the inner cell mass gets differentiated
as the embryo. After attachment, the uterine cells divide rapidly and covers
the blastocyst. As a result, the blastocyst becomes embedded in the
endometrium of the uterus (Figure 2.11 step H). This is called implantation
and it leads to pregnancy.

2.6 PREGNANCY AND EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT
After implantation, finger-like projections appear on the trophoblast called
chorionic villi which are surrounded by the uterine tissue and maternal
blood. The chorionic villi and uterine tissue become interdigitated with
each other and jointly form a structural and functional unit between
developing embryo (foetus) and maternal body called placenta (Figure 2.12).
    The placenta facilitate the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the
embryo and also removal of carbon dioxide and excretory/waste materials
produced by the embryo. The placenta is connected to the embryo through
an umbilical cord which helps in the transport of substances to and from
the embryo. Placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and produces
several hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human
placental lactogen (hPL), estrogens, progestogens, etc. In the later
phase of pregnancy, a hormone called relaxin is also secreted by
the ovary. Let us remember
that hCG, hPL and relaxin
are produced in women
only during pregnancy. In
addition, during pregnancy
the levels of other hormones
like estrogens, progestogens,
cortisol, prolactin, thyroxine,
etc., are increased several-
folds in the maternal blood.
Increased production of these
hormones is essential for
supporting the fetal growth,

mother and maintenance of
pregnancy.
    Immediately           after
implantation, the inner cell
mass (embryo) differentiates            Figure 2.12 The human foetus within the uterus

               into an outer layer called ectoderm and an inner layer called endoderm. A
               mesoderm soon appears between the ectoderm and the endoderm. These
               three layers give rise to all tissues (organs) in adults. It needs to be mentioned
               here that the inner cell mass contains certain cells called stem cells which
               have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.
                   What are the major features of embryonic development at various
               months of pregnancy? The human pregnancy lasts 9 months. Do you
               know for how many months pregnancy last in dogs, elephants, cats?
               Find out. In human beings, after one month of pregnancy, the embryo’s
               heart is formed. The first sign of growing foetus may be noticed by listening
               to the heart sound carefully through the stethoscope. By the end of the
               second month of pregnancy, the foetus develops limbs and digits. By the
               end of 12 weeks (first trimester), most of the major organ systems are
               formed, for example, the limbs and external genital organs are well-
               developed. The first movements of the foetus and appearance of hair on
               the head are usually observed during the fifth month. By the end of about
               24 weeks (end of second trimester), the body is covered with fine hair,
               eye-lids separate, and eyelashes are formed. By the end of nine months
               of pregnancy, the foetus is fully developed and is ready for delivery.

               2.7 P ARTURITION AND LACTATION
               The average duration of human pregnancy is about 9 months
               which is called the gestation period. Vigorous contraction of the uterus at
               the end of pregnancy causes expulsion/delivery of the foetus. This process
               of delivery of the foetus (childbirth) is called parturition. Parturition is
               induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism. The signals for
               parturition originate from the fully developed foetus and the placenta
               which induce mild uterine contractions called foetal ejection reflex. This
               triggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary. Oxytocin acts on
               the uterine muscle and causes stronger uterine contractions, which in
               turn stimulates further secretion of oxytocin. The stimulatory reflex between
               the uterine contraction and oxytocin secretion continues resulting in
               stronger and stronger contractions. This leads to expulsion of the baby
               out of the uterus through the birth canal – parturition. Soon after the
               infant is delivered, the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus. What do
               you think the doctors inject to induce delivery?
                   The mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during
               pregnancy and starts producing milk towards the end of pregnancy by
38             the process called lactation. This helps the mother in feeding the new-
               born. The milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called
               colostrum which contains several antibodies absolutely essential to
               develop resistance for the new-born babies. Breast-feeding during the
               initial period of infant growth is recommended by doctors for bringing up
               a healthy baby.

HUMAN REPRODUCTION



                                SUMMARY
  Humans are sexually reproducing and viviparous. The male
  reproductive system is composed of a pair of testes, the male sex
  accessory ducts and the accessory glands and external genitalia. Each
  testis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules, and each
  lobule contains one to three highly coiled seminiferous tubules. Each
  seminiferous tubule is lined inside by spermatogonia and Sertoli cells.
  The spermatogonia undergo meiotic divisions leading to sperm formation,
  while Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the dividing germ cells. The Leydig
  cells outside the seminiferous tubules, synthesise and secrete testicular
  hormones called androgens. The male external genitalia is called penis.
       The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair
  of oviducts, a uterus, a vagina, external genitalia, and a pair of
  mammary glands. The ovaries produce the female gamete (ovum) and
  some steroid hormones (ovarian hormones). Ovarian follicles in different
  stages of development are embedded in the stroma. The oviducts, uterus
  and vagina are female accessory ducts. The uterus has three layers
  namely perimetrium, myometrium and endometrium. The female
  external genitalia includes mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora,
  hymen and clitoris. The mammary glands are one of the female
  secondary sexual characteristics.
       Spermatogenesis results in the formation of sperms that are
  transported by the male sex accessory ducts. A normal human sperm
  is composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and tail. The process of
  formation of mature female gametes is called oogenesis. The
  reproductive cycle of female primates is called menstrual cycle.
  Menstrual cycle starts only after attaining sexual maturation (puberty).
  During ovulation only one ovum is released per menstrual cycle. The
  cyclical changes in the ovary and the uterus during menstrual cycle
  are induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones.
  After coitus, sperms are transported to the ampulla, where the sperm
  fertilises the ovum leading to formation of a diploid zygote. The presence
  of X or Y chromosome in the sperm determines the sex of the embryo.
  The zygote undergoes repeated mitotic division to form a blastocyst,
  which is implanted in the uterus resulting in pregnancy. After nine
  months of pregnancy, the fully developed foetus is ready for delivery.
  The process of childbirth is called parturition which is induced by a
  complex neuroendocrine mechanism involving cortisol, estrogens and
  oxytocin. Mammary glands differentiate during pregnancy and secrete
  milk after child-birth. The new-born baby is fed milk by the mother
  (lactation) during the initial few months of growth.

3.3   Medical Termination of        this term? The term simply refers to healthy reproductive
      Pregnancy                     organs with normal functions. However, it has a broader
                                    perspective and includes the emotional and social aspects
3.4   Sexually Transmitted          of reproduction also. According to the World Health
      Diseases                      Organisation (WHO), reproductive health means a total
3.5   Infertility                   well-being in all aspects of reproduction, i.e., physical,

                                    people having physically and functionally normal

                                    interactions among them in all sex-related aspects might
                                    be called reproductively healthy. Why is it significant to
                                    maintain reproductive health and what are the methods
                                    taken up to achieve it? Let us examine them.

                                        STRATEGIES
                                    India was amongst the first countries in the world to
                                    initiate action plans and programmes at a national level

               reproduction-related areas are currently in operation under the
               popular name ‘Reproductive and Child Health Care (RCH) programmes’.
               Creating awareness among people about various reproduction related
               aspects and providing facilities and support for building up a
               reproductively healthy society are the major tasks under these
               programmes.
                   With the help of audio-visual and the print-media governmental and
               non-governmental agencies have taken various steps to create awareness
               among the people about reproduction-related aspects. Parents, other
               close relatives, teachers and friends, also have a major role in the
               dissemination of the above information. Introduction of sex education
               in schools should also be encouraged to provide right information to
               the young so as to discourage children from believing in myths and
               having misconceptions about sex-related aspects. Proper information
               about reproductive organs, adolescence and related changes, safe and
               hygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), AIDS,
               etc., would help people, especially those in the adolescent age group to
               lead a reproductively healthy life. Educating people, especially fertile
               couples and those in marriageable age group, about available birth
               control options, care of pregnant mothers, post-natal care of the mother
               and child, importance of breast feeding, equal opportunities for the male
               and the female child, etc., would address the importance of bringing up
               socially conscious healthy families of desired size. Awareness of problems
               due to uncontrolled population growth, social evils like sex-abuse and
               sex-related crimes, etc., need to be created to enable people to think
               and take up necessary steps to prevent them and thereby build up a
               socially responsible and healthy society.
                   Successful implementation of various action plans to attain
               reproductive health requires strong infrastructural facilities, professional
               expertise and material support. These are essential to provide medical
               assistance and care to people in reproduction-related problems like
               pregnancy, delivery, STDs, abortions, contraception, menstrual problems,
               infertility, etc. Implementation of better techniques and new strategies
               from time to time are also required to provide more efficient care
               and assistance to people. Statutory ban on amniocentesis for
               sex-determination to legally check increasing menace of female foeticides,
               massive child immunisation, etc., are some programmes that merit
               mention in this connection. In aminocentesis some of the amniotic fluid
               of the developing foetus is taken to analyse the fetal cells and dissolved
               substances. This procedure is used to test for the presence of certain
42             genetic disorders such as, down syndrome, haemoplilia, sickle-cell
               anemia, etc., determine the survivability of the foetus.
                   Research on various reproduction-related areas are encouraged and
               supported by governmental and non-governmental agencies to find out
               new methods and/or to improve upon the existing ones. Do you know

by scientists at Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) in Lucknow, India?
Better awareness about sex related matters, increased number of medically
assisted deliveries and better post-natal care leading to decreased maternal
and infant mortality rates, increased number of couples with small
families, better detection and cure of STDs and overall increased medical
facilities for all sex-related problems, etc. all indicate improved reproductive
health of the society.

3.2 POPULATION STABILISATION AND BIRTH CONTROL
In the last century an all-round development in various fields significantly
improved the quality of life of the people. However, increased health
facilities along with better living conditions had an explosive impact on
the growth of population. The world population which was around
2 billion (2000 million) in 1900 rocketed to about 6 billion by 2000 and
7.2 billion in 2011. A similar trend was observed in India too. Our
population which was approximately 350 million at the time of our
independence reached close to the billion mark by 2000 and crossed
1.2 billion in May 2011. A rapid decline in death rate, maternal mortality
rate (MMR) and infant mortality rate (IMR) as well as an increase in
number of people in reproducible age are probable reasons for this.
Through our Reproductive Child Health (RCH) programme, though we
could bring down the population growth rate, it was only marginal.
According to the 2011 census report, the population growth rate was
less than 2 per cent, i.e., 20/1000/year, a rate at which our population
could increase rapidly. Such an alarming growth rate could lead to an
absolute scarcity of even the basic requirements, i.e., food, shelter and
clothing, in spite of significant progress made in those areas. Therefore,
the government was forced to take up serious measures to check this
population growth rate.
    The most important step to overcome this problem is to motivate smaller
families by using various contraceptive methods. You might have seen
advertisements in the media as well as posters/bills, etc., showing a happy
couple with two children with a slogan Hum Do Hamare Do (we two, our
two). Many couples, mostly the young, urban, working ones have even
adopted an ‘one child norm’. Statutory raising of marriageable age of the
female to 18 years and that of males to 21 years, and incentives given to
couples with small families are two of the other measures taken to tackle
this problem. Let us describe some of the commonly used contraceptive
methods, which help prevent unwanted pregnancies.
    An ideal contraceptive should be user-friendly, easily available,
effective and reversible with no or least side-effects. It also should in no       43
way interfere with the sexual drive, desire and/or the sexual act of the
user. A wide range of contraceptive methods are presently available which
could be broadly grouped into the following categories, namely
Natural/Traditional, Barrier, IUDs, Oral contraceptives, Injectables,
Implants and Surgical methods.

                          Natural methods work on the principle of avoiding chances of ovum
                      and sperms meeting. Periodic abstinence is one such method in which
                      the couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 10 to 17 of the menstrual
                      cycle when ovulation could be expected. As chances of fertilisation are
                      very high during this period, it is called the fertile period. Therefore, by
                                      abstaining from coitus during this period, conception could
                                      be prevented. Withdrawal or coitus interruptus is another
                                      method in which the male partner withdraws his penis from
                                      the vagina just before ejaculation so as to avoid
Figure 3.1(a) Condom for male         insemination. Lactational amenorrhea (absence of
                                      menstruation) method is based on the fact that ovulation
                                      and therefore the cycle do not occur during the period of
                                      intense lactation following parturition. Therefore, as long
                                      as the mother breast-feeds the child fully, chances of
                                      conception are almost nil. However, this method has been
                                      reported to be effective only upto a maximum period of six
                                      months following parturition. As no medicines or devices
                                      are used in these methods, side effects are almost nil.
                                      Chances of failure, though, of this method are also high.

                                      from physically meeting with the help of barriers. Such
                                      methods are available for both males and females.

                                      the ejaculated semen would not enter into the female
                                      reproductive tract. This can prevent conception. ‘Nirodh’ is
                                      a popular brand of condom for the male. Use of condoms
                                      has increased in recent years due to its additional benefit of
                                      protecting the user from contracting STIs and AIDS. Both
                                      the male and the female condoms are disposable, can be
                                      self-inserted and thereby gives privacy to the user.
                                      Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults are also barriers
                                      made of rubber that are inserted into the female reproductive
                                      tract to cover the cervix during coitus. They prevent
                                      conception by blocking the entry of sperms through the
                                      cervix. They are reusable. Spermicidal creams, jellies and
                                      foams are usually used alongwith these barriers to increase

                      in the uterus through vagina. These Intra Uterine Devices are presently
                      available as the non-medicated IUDs (e.g., Lippes loop), copper releasing

                      (Progestasert, LNG-20) (Figure 3.2). IUDs increase phagocytosis of sperms

make the uterus unsuitable for implantation and the
cervix hostile to the sperms. IUDs are ideal contraceptives
for the females who want to delay pregnancy and/or space
children. It is one of most widely accepted methods of
contraception in India.
    Oral administration of small doses of either progestogens
or progestogen –estrogen combinations is another
contraceptive method used by the females. They are used
in the form of tablets and hence are popularly called the
pills. Pills have to be taken daily for a period of 21 days
starting preferably within the first five days of menstrual                 Figure 3.3 Implants
cycle. After a gap of 7 days (during which menstruation
occurs) it has to be repeated in the same pattern till the female desires to
prevent conception. They inhibit ovulation and implantation as well as
alter the quality of cervical mucus to prevent/retard entry of sperms. Pills
are very effective with lesser side effects and are well accepted by the females.
Saheli –the new oral contraceptive for the females contains a non-steroidal
preparation. It is a ‘once a week’ pill with very few side effects and high
contraceptive value.
    Progestogens alone or in combination with estrogen can also be used
by females as injections or implants under the skin (Figure 3.3). Their
mode of action is similar to that of pills and their effective periods are
much longer. Administration of progestogens or progestogen-estrogen
combinations or IUDs within 72 hours of coitus have been found to be
very effective as emergency contraceptives as they could be used to avoid
possible pregnancy due to rape or casual unprotected intercourse.
    Surgical methods, also called sterilisation, are generally advised for
the male/female partner as a terminal method to prevent any more

Such practices should be avoided because these are dangerous both for
the young mother and the foetus. Effective counselling on the need to
avoid unprotected coitus and the risk factors involved in illegal abortions
as well as providing more health care facilities could reverse the mentioned
unhealthy trend.

3.4 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STIS)
Infections or diseases which are transmitted through sexual intercourse
are collectively called sexually transmitted infections (STI) or venereal
diseases (VD) or reproductive tract infections (RTI). Gonorrhoea, syphilis,
genital herpes, chlamydiasis, genital warts, trichomoniasis, hepatitis-B
and of course, the most discussed infection in the recent years, HIV leading
to AIDS are some of the common STIs. Among these, HIV infection is
most dangerous and is discussed in detail in Chapter 7.
    Some of these infections like hepatitis–B and HIV can also be
transmitted by sharing of injection needles, surgical instruments, etc.,
with infected persons, transfusion of blood, or from an infected mother to
the foetus too. Except for hepatitis-B, genital herpes and HIV infections,
other diseases are completely curable if detected early and treated
properly. Early symptoms of most of these are minor and include itching,
fluid discharge, slight pain, swellings, etc., in the genital region. Infected
females may often be asymptomatic and hence, may remain undetected
for long. Absence or less significant symptoms in the early stages of
infection and the social stigma attached to the STIs, deter the infected
persons from going for timely detection and proper treatment. This could
lead to complications later, which include pelvic inflammatory diseases
(PID), abortions, still births, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or even cancer
of the reproductive tract. STIs are a major threat to a healthy society.
Therefore, prevention or early detection and cure of these diseases are
given prime consideration under the reproductive health-care
programmes. Though all persons are vulnerable to these infections, their
incidences are reported to be very high among persons in the age group
of 15-24 years – the age group to which you also belong. There is no
reason to panic because prevention is possible. One could be free of these
infections by following the simple principles given below:
      (i) Avoid sex with unknown partners/multiple partners.
      (ii) Always try to use condoms during coitus.
     (iii) In case of doubt, one should go to a qualified doctor for early
           detection and get complete treatment if diagnosed with infection.
                                                                                  47
3.5 INFERTILITY
A discussion on reproductive health is incomplete without a mention of
infertility. A large number of couples all over the world including India
are infertile, i.e., they are unable to produce children inspite of unprotected

               sexual co-habitation. The reasons for this could be many–physical,
               congenital, diseases, drugs, immunological or even psychological.
               In India, often the female is blamed for the couple being childless, but
               more often than not, the problem lies in the male partner. Specialised
               health care units (infertility clinics, etc.) could help in diagnosis and
               corrective treatment of some of these disorders and enable these couples to
               have children. However, where such corrections are not possible, the couples
               could be assisted to have children through certain special techniques
               commonly known as assisted reproductive technologies (ART).
                    In vitro fertilisation (IVF–fertilisation outside the body in almost
               similar conditions as that in the body) followed by embryo transfer (ET)
               is one of such methods. In this method, popularly known as test tube
               baby programme, ova from the wife/donor (female) and sperms from the
               husband/donor (male) are collected and are induced to form zygote under
               simulated conditions in the laboratory. The zygote or early embryos (with
               upto 8 blastomeres) could then be transferred into the fallopian tube
               (ZIFT–zygote intra fallopian transfer) and embryos with more than
               8 blastomeres, into the uterus (IUT – intra uterine transfer), to complete
               its further development. Embryos formed by in-vivo fertilisation (fusion
               of gametes within the female) also could be used for such transfer to assist
               those females who cannot conceive.
                    Transfer of an ovum collected from a donor into the fallopian tube
               (GIFT – gamete intra fallopian transfer) of another female who cannot
               produce one, but can provide suitable environment for fertilisation and
               further development is another method attempted. Intra cytoplasmic
               sperm injection (ICSI) is another specialised procedure to form an embryo
               in the laboratory in which a sperm is directly injected into the ovum.
               Infertility cases either due to inability of the male partner to inseminate
               the female or due to very low sperm counts in the ejaculates, could be
               corrected by artificial insemination (AI) technique. In this technique,
               the semen collected either from the husband or a healthy donor is artificially
               introduced either into the vagina or into the uterus (IUI – intra-uterine
               insemination) of the female.
                    Though options are many, all these techniques require extremely high
               precision handling by specialised professionals and expensive
               instrumentation. Therefore, these facilities are presently available only in
               very few centres in the country. Obviously their benefits is affordable to
48             only a limited number of people. Emotional, religious and social factors
               are also deterrents in the adoption of these methods. Since the ultimate
               aim of all these procedures is to have children, in India we have so many
               orphaned and destitute children, who would probably not survive till
               maturity, unless taken care of. Our laws permit legal adoption and it is
               as yet, one of the best methods for couples looking for parenthood.

REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH




                                SUMMARY

   Reproductive health refers to a total well-being in all aspects of
   reproduction, i.e., physical, emotional, behavioural and social. Our
   nation was the first nation in the world to initiate various action plans
   at national level towards attaining a reproductively healthy society.
       Counselling and creating awareness among people about
   reproductive organs, adolescence and associated changes, safe and
   hygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
   including AIDS, etc., is the primary step towards reproductive health.
   Providing medical facilities and care to the problems like menstrual
   irregularities, pregnancy related aspects, delivery, medical termination
   of pregnancy, STIs, birth control, infertility, post natal child and
   maternal management is another important aspect of the Reproductive
   and Child Health Care programmes.
       An overall improvement in reproductive health has taken place in
   our country as indicated by reduced maternal and infant mortality
   rates, early detection and cure of STIs, assistance to infertile couples,
   etc. Improved health facilities and better living conditions promoted an
   explosive growth of population. Such a growth necessitated intense
   propagation of contraceptive methods. Various contraceptive options
   are available now such as natural, traditional, barrier, IUDs, pills,
   injectables, implants and surgical methods. Though contraceptives are
   not regular requirements for reproductive health, one is forced to use
   them to avoid pregnancy or to delay or space pregnancy.
       Medical termination of pregnancy is legalised in our country. MTP is
   generally performed to get rid of unwanted pregnancy due to rapes, casual
   relationship, etc., as also in cases when the continuation of pregnancy
   could be harmful or even fatal to either the mother, or the foetus or both.
       Infections or diseases transmitted through sexual intercourse are
   called Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STIs). Pelvic Inflammatory
   Diseases (PIDs), still birth, infertility are some of the complications of
   them. Early detection facilitate better cure of these diseases. Avoiding
   sexual intercourse with unknown/multiple partners, use of condoms
   during coitus are some of the simple precautions to avoid contracting
   STIs.
       Inability to conceive or produce children even after 2 years of
                                                                                 49
   unprotected sexual cohabitation is called infertility. Various methods
   are now available to help such couples. In Vitro fertilisation followed by
   transfer of embryo into the female genital tract is one such method and
   is commonly known as the ‘Test Tube Baby’ Programme.

Chapter 4                        The work of Mendel and others who followed him gave us an
Principles of Inheritance        idea of inheritance patterns. However the nature of those ‘factors’
and Variation                    which determine the phenotype was not very clear. As these
                                 ‘factors’ represent the genetic basis of inheritance, understanding

                                 attention in biology for the next century. The entire body of
Chapter 6                        molecular biology was a consequent development with major
Evolution                        contributions from Watson, Crick, Nirenberg, Khorana, Kornbergs

                                 have enriched our understanding of the molecular basis of

                 James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on 6 April 1928. In 1947, he
                 received B.Sc. degree in Zoology. During these years his interest in
                 bird-watching had matured into a serious desire to learn genetics. This
                 became possible when he received a Fellowship for graduate study in
                 Zoology at Indiana University, Bloomington, where he received his Ph.D.
                 degree in 1950 on a study of the effect of hard X-rays on bacteriophage
                 multiplication.
                     He met Crick and discovered their common interest in solving the
                 DNA structure. Their first serious effort, was unsatisfactory. Their second effort
                 based upon more experimental evidence and better appreciation of
                 the nucleic acid literature, resulted, early in March 1953, in the proposal
                 of the complementary double-helical configuration.

                 Diffraction: Polypeptides and Proteins”.
                     A critical influence in Crick’s career was his friendship with J. D.
                 Watson, then a young man of 23, leading in 1953 to the proposal of
                 the double-helical structure for DNA and the replication scheme. Crick
                 was made an F.R.S. in 1959.

                 Prize of the Massachusetts General Hospital, in 1959; the Lasker Award,
                 in 1960; the Research Corporation Prize, in 1962 and above all, the

PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE
AND VARIATION

4.1   Mendel’s Laws of
      Inheritance

4.2   Inheritance of One Gene     Have you ever wondered why an elephant always gives
                                  birth only to a baby elephant and not some other animal?
4.3   Inheritance of Two Genes    Or why a mango seed forms only a mango plant and not
4.4   Sex Determination           any other plant?
                                      Given that they do, are the offspring identical to their
4.5   Mutation
                                  parents? Or do they show differences in some of their
4.6   Genetic Disorders           characteristics? Have you ever wondered why siblings
                                  sometimes look so similar to each other? Or sometimes
                                  even so different?
                                      These and several related questions are dealt with,
                                  scientifically, in a branch of biology known as Genetics.
                                  This subject deals with the inheritance, as well as the
                                  variation of characters from parents to offspring.
                                  Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed
                                  on from parent to progeny; it is the basis of heredity.
                                  Variation is the degree by which progeny differ from their
                                  parents.
                                      Humans knew from as early as 8000-1000 B.C. that
                                  one of the causes of variation was hidden in sexual
                                  reproduction. They exploited the variations that were
                                  naturally present in the wild populations of plants and
                                  animals to selectively breed and select for organisms that
                                  possessed desirable characters. For example, through

                                                  It was during the mid-nineteenth century that
                                                  headway was made in the understanding of
                                                  inheritance. Gregor Mendel, conducted
                                                  hybridisation experiments on garden peas for
                                                  seven years (1856-1863) and proposed the
                                                  laws of inheritance in living organisms. During
                                                  Mendel’s investigations into inheritance
                                                  patterns it was for the first time that statistical
                                                  analysis and mathematical logic were applied
                                                  to problems in biology. His experiments had a

                                                  credibility to the data that he collected. Also,

                                                  experiments on successive generations of his
                                                  test plants, proved that his results pointed to
                                                  general rules of inheritance rather than being
                                                  unsubstantiated ideas. Mendel investigated
                                                  characters in the garden pea plant that were
                                                  manifested as two opposing traits, e.g., tall or
                                                  dwarf plants, yellow or green seeds. This
                                                  allowed him to set up a basic framework of
                                                  rules governing inheritance, which was
                                                  expanded on by later scientists to account for
                                                  all the diverse natural observations and the
                                                  complexity inherent in them.

4.2 INHERITANCE            OF   ONE GENE
Let us take the example of one such
hybridisation experiment carried out by
Mendel where he crossed tall and dwarf pea
plants to study the inheritance of one gene
(Figure 4.2). He collected the seeds produced
as a result of this cross and grew them to
generate plants of the first hybrid generation.
This generation is also called the Filial 1
progeny or the F1. Mendel observed that all
the F1 progeny plants were tall, like one of
its parents; none were dwarf (Figure 4.3). He
made similar observations for the other pairs
of traits – he found that the F1 always
resembled either one of the parents, and that
the trait of the other parent was not seen in
them.
    Mendel then self-pollinated the tall F1
plants and to his surprise found that in the
Filial2 generation some of the offspring were
‘dwarf ’; the character that was not seen in
the F1 generation was now expressed. The                 Figure 4.2 Steps in making a cross in pea
proportion of plants that were dwarf were
1/4th of the F2 plants while 3/4th of the F2 plants were tall. The tall and
dwarf traits were identical to their parental type and did not show any
blending, that is all the offspring were either tall or dwarf, none were of in-                 55
between height (Figure 4.3).
    Similar results were obtained with the other traits that he studied:
only one of the parental traits was expressed in the F1 generation while at
the F2 stage both the traits were expressed in the proportion 3:1. The
contrasting traits did not show any blending at either F1 or F2 stage.

                                                            Based on these observations,
                                                       Mendel proposed that something
                                                       was being stably passed down,
                                                       unchanged, from parent to offspring
                                                       through the gametes, over
                                                       successive generations. He called
                                                       these things as ‘factors’. Now we call
                                                       them as genes. Genes, therefore, are
                                                       the units of inheritance. They
                                                       contain the information that is
                                                       required to express a particular trait
                                                       in an organism. Genes which code
                                                       for a pair of contrasting traits are
                                                       known as alleles, i.e., they are
                                                       slightly different forms of the same
                                                       gene.
                                                            If we use alphabetical symbols
                                                       for each gene, then the capital letter
                                                       is used for the trait expressed at the
                                                       F1 stage and the small alphabet for
                                                       the other trait. For example, in case
                                                       of the character of height, T is used
                                                       for the Tall trait and t for the ‘dwarf’,
                                                       and T and t are alleles of each other.
                                                       Hence, in plants the pair of alleles
                                                       for height would be TT, Tt or tt.
     Figure 4.3 Diagrammatic representation            Mendel also proposed that in a true
                of monohybrid cross                    breeding, tall or dwarf pea variety
                                                       the allelic pair of genes for height are
               identical or homozygous, TT and tt, respectively. TT and tt are called the
               genotype of the plant while the descriptive terms tall and dwarf are the
               phenotype. What then would be the phenotype of a plant that had a
               genotype Tt?
                   As Mendel found the phenotype of the F1 heterozygote Tt to be exactly
               like the TT parent in appearance, he proposed that in a pair of dissimilar
               factors, one dominates the other (as in the F1 ) and hence is called the
               dominant factor while the other factor is recessive . In this case T (for
               tallness) is dominant over t (for dwarfness), that is recessive. He observed
56             identical behaviour for all the other characters/trait-pairs that he studied.
                   It is convenient (and logical) to use the capital and lower case of an
               alphabetical symbol to remember this concept of dominance and
               recessiveness. (Do not use T for tall and d for dwarf because you will
               find it difficult to remember whether T and d are alleles of the same
               gene/character or not). Alleles can be similar as in the case of homozygotes
               TT and tt or can be dissimilar as in the case of the heterozygote Tt. Since

PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION


the Tt plant is heterozygous for genes controlling
one character (height), it is a monohybrid and the
cross between TT and tt is a monohybrid cross.
    From the observation that the recessive parental
trait is expressed without any blending in the F2
generation, we can infer that, when the tall and
dwarf plant produce gametes, by the process of
meiosis, the alleles of the parental pair separate or
segregate from each other and only one allele is
transmitted to a gamete. This segregation of alleles
is a random process and so there is a 50 per cent
chance of a gamete containing either allele, as has
been verified by the results of the crossings. In this
way the gametes of the tall TT plants have the allele
T and the gametes of the dwarf tt plants have the
allele t. During fertilisation the two alleles, T from
one parent say, through the pollen, and t from the
other parent, then through the egg, are united to
produce zygotes that have one T allele and one t
allele. In other words the hybrids have Tt. Since
these hybrids contain alleles which express
contrasting traits, the plants are heterozygous. The
production of gametes by the parents, the formation
of the zygotes, the F 1 and F 2 plants can be
understood from a diagram called Punnett
Square as shown in Figure 4.4. It was developed
by a British geneticist, Reginald C. Punnett. It is a
graphical representation to calculate the
probability of all possible genotypes of offspring in
a genetic cross. The possible gametes are written
on two sides, usually the top row and left columns.
All possible combinations are represented in boxes
below in the squares, which generates a square
output form.
    The Punnett Square shows the parental tall TT
(male) and dwarf tt (female) plants, the gametes
produced by them and, the F1 Tt progeny. The F1
plants of genotype Tt are self-pollinated. The
symbols & and % are used to denote the female (eggs) and male (pollen)

T have a 50 per cent chance to pollinate eggs of the genotype T, as well as
of genotype t. Also pollen grains of genotype t have a 50 per cent chance

               of pollinating eggs of genotype T, as well as of genotype t. As a result of
               random fertilisation, the resultant zygotes can be of the genotypes TT, Tt
               or tt.
                     From the Punnett square it is easily seen that 1/4th of the random
               fertilisations lead to TT, 1/2 lead to Tt and 1/4th to tt. Though the F1
               have a genotype of Tt, but the phenotypic character seen is ‘tall’. At F 2,
               3/4th of the plants are tall, where some of them are TT while others are Tt.
               Externally it is not possible to distinguish between the plants with the
               genotypes TT and Tt. Hence, within the genopytic pair Tt only one character
               ‘T ’ tall is expressed. Hence the character T or ‘tall’ is said to dominate over
               the other allele t or ‘dwarf’ character. It is thus due to this dominance of
               one character over the other that all the F1 are tall (though the genotype is
               Tt) and in the F 2 3/4th of the plants are tall (though genotypically 1/2 are
               Tt and only 1/4th are TT). This leads to a phenotypic ratio of 3/4 th tall :
               (1/4 TT + 1/2 Tt) and 1/4th tt, i.e., a 3:1 ratio, but a genotypic ratio of
               1:2:1.
                     The 1/4 : 1/2 : 1/4 ratio of TT: Tt: tt is mathematically condensable
               to the form of the binomial expression (ax +by)2, that has the gametes
               bearing genes T or t in equal frequency of ½. The expression is expanded
               as given below :

               (1/2T + 1/2 t)2 = (1/2T + 1/2t) X (1/2T + 1/2t) = 1/4 TT + 1/2Tt + 1/4 tt

                   Mendel self-pollinated the F2 plants and found that dwarf F2 plants
               continued to generate dwarf plants in F3 and F4 generations. He concluded
               that the genotype of the dwarfs was homozygous – tt. What do you think
               he would have got had he self-pollinated a tall F2 plant?
                   From the preceeding paragraphs it is clear that though the genotypic
               ratios can be calculated using mathematical probability, by simply looking
               at the phenotype of a dominant trait, it is not possible to know the
               genotypic composition. That is, for example, whether a tall plant from F1
               or F2 has TT or Tt composition, cannot be predicted. Therefore, to determine
               the genotype of a tall plant at F2, Mendel crossed the tall plant from F2
               with a dwarf plant. This he called a test cross. In a typical test cross an
               organism (pea plants here) showing a dominant phenotype (and whose
               genotype is to be determined) is crossed with the recessive parent instead
               of self-crossing. The progenies of such a cross can easily be analysed to
               predict the genotype of the test organism. Figure 4.5 shows the results of
58             typical test cross where violet colour flower (W) is dominant over white
               colour flower (w).
               Using Punnett square, try to find out the nature of offspring of a test cross.
               What ratio did you get?

a test cross?
    Based on his observations on monohybrid crosses Mendel proposed
two general rules to consolidate his understanding of inheritance in
monohybrid crosses. Today these rules are called the Principles or
Laws of Inheritance: the First Law or Law of Dominance and the
Second Law or Law of Segregation.

4.2.1 Law of Dominance
      (i) Characters are controlled by discrete units called factors.
     (ii) Factors occur in pairs.
     (iii) In a dissimilar pair of factors one member of the pair dominates
           (dominant) the other (recessive).
    The law of dominance is used to explain the expression of only one of
the parental characters in a monohybrid cross in the F1 and the expression
of both in the F2. It also explains the proportion of 3:1 obtained at the F2.

4.2.2 Law of Segregation
This law is based on the fact that the alleles do not show any blending
                                                                                  59
and that both the characters are recovered as such in the F2 generation
though one of these is not seen at the F1 stage. Though the parents contain
two alleles during gamete formation, the factors or alleles of a pair segregate
from each other such that a gamete receives only one of the two factors.
Of course, a homozygous parent produces all gametes that are similar
while a heterozygous one produces two kinds of gametes each having
one allele with equal proportion.

                                                   4.2.2.1 Incomplete Dominance
                                                   When experiments on peas were repeated using other
                                                   traits in other plants, it was found that sometimes
                                                   the F1 had a phenotype that did not resemble either
                                                   of the two parents and was in between the two. The
                                                   inheritance of flower colour in the dog flower
                                                   (snapdragon or Antirrhinum sp.) is a good example
                                                   to understand incomplete dominance. In a cross
                                                   between true-breeding red-flowered (RR) and true-
                                                   breeding white-flowered plants (rr), the F1 (Rr) was
                                                   pink (Figure 4.6). When the F1 was self-pollinated
                                                   the F2 resulted in the following ratio 1 (RR) Red : 2
                                                   (Rr) Pink : 1 (rr) White. Here the genotype ratios were
                                                   exactly as we would expect in any mendelian
                                                   monohybrid cross, but the phenotype ratios had
                                                   changed from the 3:1 dominant : recessive ratio.
                                                   What happened was that R was not completely
                                                   dominant over r and this made it possible to
                                                   distinguish Rr as pink from RR (red) and rr (white) .
                                             Explanation of the concept of dominance:
                                             What exactly is dominance? Why are some alleles
                                             dominant and some recessive? To tackle these
                                             questions, we must understand what a gene does.
                                             Every gene, as you know by now, contains the
                                             information to express a particular trait. In a
                                             diploid organism, there are two copies of each
                                             gene, i.e., as a pair of alleles. Now, these two alleles
                                             need not always be identical, as in a heterozygote.
                                             One of them may be different due to some changes
                                             that it has undergone (about which you will read
                                             further on, and in the next chapter) which modifies
                                             the information that particular allele contains.
                                                  Let’s take an example of a gene that contains
                                             the information for producing an enzyme. Now

           dominant over the other allele    the normal allele produces the normal enzyme
                                             that is needed for the transformation of a
 60                   substrate S. Theoretically, the modified allele could be responsible for
                      production of –

                              (ii) a non-functional enzyme, or
                             (iii) no enzyme at all

PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION


      In the first case, the modified allele is equivalent to the unmodified allele,
i.e., it will produce the same phenotype/trait, i.e., result in the transformation
of substrate S. Such equivalent allele pairs are very common. But, if the
allele produces a non-functional enzyme or no enzyme, the phenotype may
be effected. The phenotype/trait will only be dependent on the functioning
of the unmodified allele. The unmodified (functioning) allele, which represents
the original phenotype is the dominant allele and the modified allele is
generally the recessive allele. Hence, in the example above the recessive trait
is seen due to non-functional enzyme or because no enzyme is produced.

4.2.2.2 Co-dominance
Till now we were discussing crosses where the F1 resembled either of the
two parents (dominance) or was in-between (incomplete dominance). But,
in the case of co-dominance the F1 generation resembles both parents. A
good example is different types of red blood cells that determine ABO
blood grouping in human beings. ABO blood groups are controlled by
the gene I. The plasma membrane of the red blood cells has sugar polymers
that protrude from its surface and the kind of sugar is controlled by the
gene. The gene (II ) has three alleles IA , IB and i . The alleles I A and IB produce
a slightly different form of the sugar while allele i does not produce any
sugar. Because humans are diploid organisms, each person possesses
any two of the three I gene alleles. I A and I B are completely dominant over
i , in other words when I A and i are present only I A expresses (because i
does not produce any sugar), and when I B and i are present I B expresses.
But when I A and I B are present together they both express their own types
of sugars: this is because of co-dominance. Hence red blood cells have
both A and B types of sugars. Since there are three different alleles, there
are six different combinations of these three alleles that are possible, and
therefore, a total of six different genotypes of the human ABO blood types
(Table 4.2). How many phenotypes are possible?

                   Do you realise that the example of ABO blood grouping also provides
               a good example of multiple alleles? Here you can see that there are
               more than two, i.e., three alleles, governing the same character. Since in
               an individual only two alleles can be present, multiple alleles can be found
               only when population studies are made.
                   Occasionally, a single gene product may produce more than one effect.
               For example, starch synthesis in pea seeds is controlled by one gene. It
               has two alleles (B and b). Starch is synthesised effectively by B B
               homozygotes and therefore, large starch grains are produced. In contrast,
               b b homozygotes have lesser efficiency in starch synthesis and produce
               smaller starch grains. After maturation of the seeds, B B seeds are round
               and the b b seeds are wrinkled. Heterozygotes produce round seeds, and
               so B seems to be the dominant allele. But, the starch grains produced are
               of intermediate size in B b seeds. So if starch grain size is considered as
               the phenotype, then from this angle, the alleles show incomplete
               dominance.
                   Therefore, dominance is not an autonomous feature of a gene or the
               product that it has information for. It depends as much on the gene
               product and the production of a particular phenotype from this product
               as it does on the particular phenotype that we choose to examine, in case
               more than one phenotype is influenced by the same gene.

               4.3 INHERITANCE OF TWO GENES
               Mendel also worked with and crossed pea plants that differed in two
               characters, as is seen in the cross between a pea plant that has seeds with
               yellow colour and round shape and one that had seeds of green colour
               and wrinkled shape (Figure 4.7). Mendel found that the seeds resulting
               from the crossing of the parents, had yellow coloured and round shaped
               seeds. Here can you tell which of the characters in the pairs yellow/
               green colour and round/wrinkled shape was dominant?
                   Thus, yellow colour was dominant over green and round shape
               dominant over wrinkled. These results were identical to those that he got
               when he made separate monohybrid crosses between yellow and green
               seeded plants and between round and wrinkled seeded plants.
                   Let us use the genotypic symbols Y for dominant yellow seed colour
               and y for recessive green seed colour, R for round shaped seeds and r for
               wrinkled seed shape. The genotype of the parents can then be written as
               RRYY and rryy. The cross between the two plants can be written down
62             as in Figure 4.7 showing the genotypes of the parent plants. The gametes
               RY and ry unite on fertilisation to produce the F1 hybrid RrYy. When
               Mendel self hybridised the F1 plants he found that 3/4th of F2 plants had
               yellow seeds and 1/4th had green. The yellow and green colour segregated
               in a 3:1 ratio. Round and wrinkled seed shape also segregated in a 3:1
               ratio; just like in a monohybrid cross.

               4.3.1 Law of Independent Assortment
               In the dihybrid cross (Figure 4.7), the phenotypes round, yellow;
               wrinkled, yellow; round, green and wrinkled, green appeared in the
               ratio 9:3:3:1. Such a ratio was observed for several pairs of characters
               that Mendel studied.
                   The ratio of 9:3:3:1 can be derived as a combination series of 3 yellow:
               1 green, with 3 round : 1 wrinkled. This derivation can be written
               as follows:
                   (3 Round : 1 Wrinkled) (3 Yellow : 1 Green) = 9 Round, Yellow : 3
               Wrinkled, Yellow: 3 Round, Green : 1 Wrinkled, Green
                   Based upon such observations on dihybrid crosses (crosses between
               plants differing in two traits) Mendel proposed a second set of generalisations
               that we call Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment. The law states that
               ‘when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair
               of characters is independent of the other pair of characters’.
                   The Punnett square can be effectively used to understand the
               independent segregation of the two pairs of genes during meiosis and
               the production of eggs and pollen in the F1 RrYy plant. Consider the
               segregation of one pair of genes R and r. Fifty per cent of the gametes
               have the gene R and the other 50 per cent have r. Now besides each
               gamete having either R or r, it should also have the allele Y or y. The
               important thing to remember here is that segregation of 50 per cent R
               and 50 per cent r is independent from the segregation of 50 per cent
               Y and 50 per cent y. Therefore, 50 per cent of the r bearing gametes
               has Y and the other 50 per cent has y. Similarly, 50 per cent of the R
               bearing gametes has Y and the other 50 per cent has y. Thus there are
               four genotypes of gametes (four types of pollen and four types of eggs).
               The four types are RY, Ry, rY     Y and ry each with a frequency of 25 per
                             th
               cent or 1/4 of the total gametes produced. When you write down the
               four types of eggs and pollen on the two sides of a Punnett square it is
               very easy to derive the composition of the zygotes that give rise to the
               F2 plants (Figure 4.7). Although there are 16 squares how many
               different types of genotypes and phenotypes are formed? Note them
               down in the format given.
                   Can you, using the Punnett square data work out the genotypic ratio
               at the F2 stage and fill in the format given? Is the genotypic ratio
               also 9:3:3:1?

               4.3.2 Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
               Mendel published his work on inheritance of characters in 1865 but
               for several reasons, it remained unrecognised till 1900. Firstly,

PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION


communication was not easy (as it is now) in those days and his work
could not be widely publicised. Secondly, his concept of genes (or
factors, in Mendel’s words) as stable and discrete units that controlled
the expression of traits and, of the pair of alleles which did not ‘blend’
with each other, was not accepted by his contemporaries as an
explanation for the apparently continuous variation seen in nature.
Thirdly, Mendel’s approach of using mathematics to explain biological
phenomena was totally new and unacceptable to many of the
biologists of his time. Finally, though Mendel’s work suggested that
factors (genes) were discrete units, he could not provide any physical
proof for the existence of factors or say what they were made of.
    In 1900, three Scientists (de Vries, Correns and von Tschermak)
independently rediscovered Mendel’s results on the inheritance of
characters. Also, by this time due to advancements in microscopy that
were taking place, scientists were able to carefully observe cell division.
This led to the discovery of structures in the nucleus that appeared to
double and divide just before each cell division. These were called
chromosomes (colored bodies, as they were visualised by staining). By
1902, the chromosome movement during meiosis had been worked out.
Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri noted that the behaviour of
chromosomes was parallel to the behaviour of genes and used
chromosome movement (Figure 4.8) to explain Mendel’s laws (Table 4.3).
Recall that you have studied the behaviour of chromosomes during mitosis
(equational division) and during meiosis (reduction division). The
important things to remember are that chromosomes as well as genes
occur in pairs. The two alleles of a gene pair are located on homologous
sites on homologous chromosomes.

PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION


    Sutton and Boveri argued that the pairing and separation of a
pair of chromosomes would lead to the segregation of a pair of
factors they carried. Sutton united the knowledge of chromosomal
segregation with Mendelian principles and called it the
chromosomal theory of inheritance.
    Following this synthesis of ideas, experimental verification of
the chromosomal theory of inheritance by Thomas Hunt Morgan
and his colleagues, led to discovering the basis for the variation      (a)          (b)
that sexual reproduction produced. Morgan worked with the tiny Figure 4.10 Drosophila
fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 4.10), which were         melanogaster (a) Male
                                                                            (b) Female
found very suitable for such studies. They could be grown on
simple synthetic medium in the laboratory. They complete their life
cycle in about two weeks, and a single mating could produce a large
number of progeny flies. Also, there was a clear differentiation of the
sexes – the male and female flies are easily distinguishable. Also, it
has many types of hereditary variations that can be seen with low
power microscopes.

4.3.3 Linkage and Recombination
Morgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in Drosophila to study genes
that were sex-linked. The crosses were similar to the dihybrid crosses carried
out by Mendel in peas. For example Morgan hybridised yellow-bodied,
white-eyed females to brown-bodied, red-eyed males and intercrossed their
F1 progeny. He observed that the two genes did not segregate independently
of each other and the F2 ratio deviated very significantly from the 9:3:3:1
ratio (expected when the two genes are independent).
    Morgan and his group knew that the genes were located on the X
chromosome (Section 4.4) and saw quickly that when the two genes in a
dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion
of parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental
type. Morgan attributed this due to the physical association or linkage
of the two genes and coined the term linkage to describe this physical
association of genes on a chromosome and the term recombination to
describe the generation of non-parental gene combinations (Figure 4.11).
Morgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped
on the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked (showed
very low recombination) (Figure 4.11, Cross A) while others were loosely
linked (showed higher recombination) (Figure 4.11, Cross B). For
                                                                                        67
example he found that the genes white and yellow were very tightly linked
and showed only 1.3 per cent recombination while white and miniature
wing showed 37.2 per cent recombination. His student Alfred
Sturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs
on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes
and ‘mapped’ their position on the chromosome. Today genetic maps

PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION


4.4 POLYGENIC INHERITANCE
Mendel’s studies mainly described those traits that have distinct alternate
forms such as flower colour which are either purple or white. But if you
look around you will find that there are many traits which are not so
distinct in their occurrence and are spread across a gradient. For example,
in humans we don’t just have tall or short people as two distinct
alternatives but a whole range of possible heights. Such traits are generally
controlled by three or more genes and are thus called as polygenic traits.
Besides the involvement of multiple genes polygenic inheritance also takes
into account the influence of environment. Human skin colour is another
classic example for this. In a polygenic trait the phenotype reflects the
contribution of each allele, i.e., the effect of each allele is additive. To
understand this better let us assume that three genes A, B, C control skin
colour in human with the dominant forms A, B and C responsible for
dark skin colour and the recessive forms a, b and c for light skin colour.
The genotype with all the dominant alleles (AABBCC) will have the darkest
skin colour and that with all the recessive alleles (aabbcc) will have the
lightest skin colour. As expected the genotype with three dominant alleles
and three recessive alleles will have an intermediate skin colour. In this
manner the number of each type of alleles in the genotype would determine
the darkness or lightness of the skin in an individual.

4.5 PLEIOTROPY
We have so far seen the effect of a gene on a single phenotype or trait.
There are however instances where a single gene can exhibit multiple
phenotypic expression. Such a gene is called a pleiotropic gene. The
underlying mechanism of pleiotropy in most cases is the effect of a gene
on metabolic pathways which contribute towards different phenotypes.
An example of this is the disease phenylketonuria, which occurs in
humans. The disease is caused by mutation in the gene that codes for the
enzyme phenyl alanine hydroxylase (single gene mutation). This manifests
itself through phenotypic expression characterised by mental
retardation and a reduction in hair and skin pigmentation.

4.6 SEX DETERMINATION
The mechanism of sex determination has always been a puzzle before the
geneticists. The initial clue about the genetic/chromosomal mechanism
of sex determination can be traced back to some of the experiments carried
out in insects. In fact, the cytological observations made in a number of
insects led to the development of the concept of genetic/chromosomal
basis of sex-determination. Henking (1891) could trace a specific nuclear       69
structure all through spermatogenesis in a few insects, and it was also
observed by him that 50 per cent of the sperm received this structure
after spermatogenesis, whereas the other 50 per cent sperm did not receive
it. Henking gave a name to this structure as the X body but he could not
explain its significance. Further investigations by other scientists led to
the conclusion that the ‘X body’ of Henking was in fact a chromosome

                                                     X-chromosome. It was also observed that in
                                                     a large number of insects the mechanism of
                                                     sex determination is of the XO type, i.e., all
                                                     eggs bear an additional X-chromosome
                                                     besides the other chromosomes
                                                     (autosomes). On the other hand, some of the
                                                     sperms bear the X-chromosome whereas
                                                     some do not. Eggs fertilised by sperm having

                                                     chromosomes. Both males and females bear
                       same number of autosomes. Hence, the males have autosomes plus XY,
                       while female have autosomes plus XX. In human beings and in
                       Drosophila the males have one X and one Y chromosome, whereas females
                       have a pair of X-chromosomes besides autosomes (Figure 4.12 a, b).
                            In the above description you have studied about two types of sex
                       determining mechanisms, i.e., XO type and XY type. But in both cases
                       males produce two different types of gametes, (a) either with or without

                       to be the example of male heterogamety. In some other organisms, e.g.,
                       birds, a different mechanism of sex determination is observed (Figure
                       4.12 c). In this case the total number of chromosome is same in both
                       males and females. But two different types of gametes in terms of the sex

chromosomes, are produced by females, i.e., female heterogamety. In
order to have a distinction with the mechanism of sex determination
described earlier, the two different sex chromosomes of a female bird has
been designated to be the Z and W chromosomes. In these organisms the
females have one Z and one W chromosome, whereas males have a pair of
Z-chromosomes besides the autosomes.

4.6.1 Sex Determination in Humans
It has already been mentioned that the sex determining mechanism in
case of humans is XY type. Out of 23 pairs of chromosomes present,
22 pairs are exactly same in both males and females; these are the
autosomes. A pair of X-chromosomes are present in the female, whereas
the presence of an X and Y chromosome are determinant of the male
characteristic. During spermatogenesis among males, two types of
gametes are produced. 50 per cent of the total sperm produced carry
the X-chromosome and the rest 50 per cent has Y-chromosome besides
the autosomes. Females, however, produce only one type of ovum with
an X-chromosome. There is an equal probability of fertilisation of the
ovum with the sperm carrying either X or Y chromosome. In case the
ovum fertilises with a sperm carrying X-chromosome the zygote develops
into a female (XX) and the fertilisation of ovum with Y-chromosome
carrying sperm results into a male offspring. Thus, it is evident that it
is the genetic makeup of the sperm that determines the sex of the child.
It is also evident that in each pregnancy there is always 50 per cent
probability of either a male or a female child. It is unfortunate that in
our society women are blamed for giving birth to female children and
have been ostracised and ill-treated because of this false notion.

4.6.2 Sex Determination in Honey Bee
The sex determination in honey bee is
based on the number of sets of
chromosomes an individual receives. An
offspring formed from the union of a
sperm and an egg develops as a female
(queen or worker), and an unfertilised
egg develops as a male (drone) by means
of parthenogenesis. This means that the
males have half the number of
chromosomes than that of a female. The          Figure 4.13 Sex determination in honey bee
females are diploid having 32
chromosomes and males are haploid, i.e., having 16 chromosomes.                         71
This is called as haplodiploid sex-determination system and has special
characteristic features such as the males produce sperms by mitosis
(Figure 4.13), they do not have father and thus cannot have sons, but
have a grandfather and can have grandsons.
    How is the sex-determination mechanism different in the birds?
Is the sperm or the egg responsible for the sex of the chicks?

                       4.7 MUTATION
                       Mutation is a phenomenon which results in alteration of DNA sequences
                       and consequently results in changes in the genotype and the phenotype
                       of an organism. In addition to recombination, mutation is another
                       phenomenon that leads to variation in DNA.
                           As you will learn in Chapter 5, one DNA helix runs continuously from
                       one end to the other in each chromatid, in a highly supercoiled form.
                       Therefore loss (deletions) or gain (insertion/duplication) of a segment of
                       DNA, result in alteration in chromosomes. Since genes are known to be
                       located on chromosomes, alteration in chromosomes results in
                                            abnormalities or aberrations. Chromosomal
                                            aberrations are commonly observed in cancer cells.

                                            to change in a single base pair of DNA. This is known
                                            as point mutation. A classical example of such a
                                            mutation is sickle cell anemia. Deletions and insertions
                                            of base pairs of DNA, causes frame-shift mutations
                                            (see Chapter 5).
                                                 The mechanism of mutation is beyond the scope
                                            of this discussion, at this level. However, there are
                                            many chemical and physical factors that induce
                                            mutations. These are referred to as mutagens. UV
                                            radiations can cause mutations in organisms – it is a
                                            mutagen.

                                              4.8.1 Pedigree Analysis
                                             The idea that disorders are inherited has been
                                             prevailing in the human society since long. This was
                                             based on the heritability of certain characteristic
                                             features in families. After the rediscovery of Mendel’s
                                             work the practice of analysing inheritance pattern of
                                             traits in human beings began. Since it is evident that
                                             control crosses that can be performed in pea plant or

                                             inheritance of a particular trait provides an
                      alternative. Such an analysis of traits in a several of generations of a family
                      is called the pedigree analysis. In the pedigree analysis the inheritance
                      of a particular trait is represented in the family tree over generations.
 72
                          In human genetics, pedigree study provides a strong tool, which is
                      utilised to trace the inheritance of a specific trait, abnormality or disease.
                      Some of the important standard symbols used in the pedigree analysis
                      have been shown in Figure 4.13.

in the chromosome. DNA is the carrier of genetic information. It is hence
transmitted from one generation to the other without any change or
alteration. However, changes or alteration do take place occasionally. Such
an alteration or change in the genetic material is referred to as mutation.
A number of disorders in human beings have been found to be associated
with the inheritance of changed or altered genes or chromosomes.

4.8.2 Mendelian Disorders
Broadly, genetic disorders may be grouped into two categories – Mendelian
disorders and Chromosomal disorders. Mendelian disorders are mainly
determined by alteration or mutation in the single gene. These disorders
are transmitted to the offspring on the same lines as we have studied in
the principle of inheritance. The pattern of inheritance of such Mendelian
disorders can be traced in a family by the pedigree analysis. Most common
and prevalent Mendelian disorders are Haemophilia, Cystic fibrosis, Sickle-
cell anaemia, Colour blindness, Phenylketonuria, Thalassemia, etc. It is
important to mention here that such Mendelian disorders may be
dominant or recessive. By pedigree analysis one can easily understand
whether the trait in question is dominant or recessive. Similarly, the trait
may also be linked to the sex chromosome as in case of haemophilia. It is
evident that this X-linked recessive trait shows transmission from carrier
female to male progeny. A representative pedigree is shown in Figure 4.14
for dominant and recessive traits. Discuss with your teacher and design
pedigrees for characters linked to both autosomes and sex chromosome.

present in the X chromosome. It occurs in about 8 per cent of males and
only about 0.4 per cent of females. This is because the genes that lead to
red-green colour blindness are on the X chromosome. Males have only
one X chromosome and females have two. The son of a woman who carries

                      the gene has a 50 per cent chance of being colour blind. The mother is
                      not herself colour blind because the gene is recessive. That means that its
                      effect is suppressed by her matching dominant normal gene. A daughter
                      will not normally be colour blind, unless her mother is a carrier and her
                      father is colour blind.
                      Haemophilia : This sex linked recessive disease, which shows its
                      transmission from unaffected carrier female to some of the male progeny
                      has been widely studied. In this disease, a single protein that is a part of
                      the cascade of proteins involved in the clotting of blood is affected. Due to
                      this, in an affected individual a simple cut will result in non-stop bleeding.
                      The heterozygous female (carrier) for haemophilia may transmit the disease
                      to sons. The possibility of a female becoming a haemophilic is extremely
                      rare because mother of such a female has to be at least carrier and the
                      father should be haemophilic (unviable in the later stage of life). The family
                      pedigree of Queen Victoria shows a number of haemophilic descendents
                      as she was a carrier of the disease.
                      Sickle-cell anaemia : This is an autosome linked recessive trait that
                      can be transmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners
                      are carrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The disease is controlled by a
                      single pair of allele, HbA and HbS. Out of the three possible genotypes only
                      homozygous individuals for HbS (HbSHbS) show the diseased phenotype.
                      Heterozygous (HbA HbS) individuals appear apparently unaffected but they
                      are carrier of the disease as there is 50 per cent probability of transmission
                      of the mutant gene to the progeny, thus exhibiting sickle-cell trait
                      (Figure 4.15). The defect is caused by the substitution of Glutamic acid

(Glu) by Valine (Val) at the sixth position of the beta globin chain of the
haemoglobin molecule. The substitution of amino acid in the globin
protein results due to the single base substitution at the sixth codon of
the beta globin gene from GAG to GUG. The mutant haemoglobin molecule
undergoes polymerisation under low oxygen tension causing the change
in the shape of the RBC from biconcave disc to elongated sickle like
structure (Figure 4.15).
Phenylketonuria : This inborn error of metabolism is also inherited as
the autosomal recessive trait. The affected individual lacks an enzyme
that converts the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. As a result of
this phenylalanine is accumulated and converted into phenylpyruvic acid
and other derivatives. Accumulation of these in brain results in mental
retardation. These are also excreted through urine because of its poor
absorption by kidney.
Thalassemia : This is also an autosome-linked recessive blood disease
transmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners are
unaffected carrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The defect could be due
to either mutation or deletion which ultimately results in reduced rate of
synthesis of one of the globin chains (α and β chains) that make up
haemoglobin. This causes the formation of abnormal haemoglobin
molecules resulting into anaemia which is characteristic of the disease.
Thalassemia can be classified according to which chain of the haemoglobin
molecule is affected. In α Thalassemia, production of α globin chain is
affected while in β Thalassemia, production of β globin chain is affected.
α Thalassemia is controlled by two closely linked genes HBA1 and HBA2
on chromosome 16 of each parent and it is observed due to mutation or
deletion of one or more of the four genes. The more genes affected, the
less alpha globin molecules produced. While β Thalassemia is controlled
by a single gene HBB on chromosome 11 of each parent and occurs due
to mutation of one or both the genes. Thalassemia differs from sickle-cell
anaemia in that the former is a quantitative problem of synthesising too
few globin molecules while the latter is a qualitative problem of
synthesising an incorrectly functioning globin.
4.8.3 Chromosomal Disorders
The chromosomal disorders on the other hand are caused due to absence
or excess or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes.
    Failure of segregation of chromatids during cell division cycle results
in the gain or loss of a chromosome(s), called aneuploidy. For example,
Down’s syndrome results in the gain of extra copy of chromosome 21.
Similarly, Turner’s syndrome results due to loss of an X chromosome in
human females. Failure of cytokinesis after telophase stage of cell division
results in an increase in a whole set of chromosomes in an organism and,       75
this phenomenon is known as polyploidy. This condition is often seen in
plants.
    The total number of chromosomes in a normal human cell is 46
(23 pairs). Out of these 22 pairs are autosomes and one pair of
chromosomes are sex chromosome. Sometimes, though rarely, either an
additional copy of a chromosome may be included in an individual or an

                                               or monosomy of a chromosome, respectively. Such a

PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION




                                SUMMARY
   Genetics is a branch of biology which deals with principles of inheritance
   and its practices. Progeny resembling the parents in morphological and
   physiological features has attracted the attention of many biologists.
   Mendel was the first to study this phenomenon systematically. While
   studying the pattern of inheritance in pea plants of contrasting
   characters, Mendel proposed the principles of inheritance, which are
   today referred to as ‘Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance’. He proposed that
   the ‘factors’ (later named as genes) regulating the characters are found
   in pairs known as alleles. He observed that the expression of the
   characters in the offspring follow a definite pattern in different–first
   generations (F1), second (F2) and so on. Some characters are dominant
   over others. The dominant characters are expressed when factors are
   in heterozygous condition (Law of Dominance). The recessive characters
   are only expressed in homozygous conditions. The characters never
   blend in heterozygous condition. A recessive character that was not
   expressed in heterozygous conditon may be expressed again when it
   becomes homozygous. Hence, characters segregate while formation of
   gametes (Law of Segregation).
       Not all characters show true dominance. Some characters show
   incomplete, and some show co-dominance. When Mendel studied the
   inheritance of two characters together, it was found that the factors
   independently assort and combine in all permutations and
   combinations (Law of Independent Assortment). Different combinations
   of gametes are theoretically represented in a square tabular form known
   as ‘Punnett Square’. The factors (now known as gene) on chromosomes
   regulating the characters are called the genotype and the physical
   expression of the chraracters is called phenotype.
       After knowing that the genes are located on the chromosomes, a
   good correlation was drawn between Mendel’s laws : segregation and
   assortment of chromosomes during meiosis. The Mendel’s laws were
   extended in the form of ‘Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance’. Later, it
   was found that Mendel’s law of independent assortment does not hold
   true for the genes that were located on the same chromosomes. These
   genes were called as ‘linked genes’. Closely located genes assorted
   together, and distantly located genes, due to recombination, assorted
   independently. Linkage maps, therefore, corresponded to arrangement
   of genes on a chromosome.
       Many genes were linked to sexes also, and called as sex-linked
   genes. The two sexes (male and female) were found to have a set of
   chromosomes which were common, and another set which was
   different. The chromosomes which were different in two sexes were
   named as sex chromosomes. The remaining set was named as
   autosomes. In humans, a normal female has 22 pairs of autosomes
   and a pair of sex chromosomes (XX). A male has 22 pairs of autosomes
   and a pair of sex chromosome as XY. In chicken, sex chromosomes in           77
   male are ZZ, and in females are ZW.
       Mutation is defined as change in the genetic material. A point
   mutation is a change of a single base pair in DNA. Sickle-cell anemia is
   caused due to change of one base in the gene coding for beta-chain of
   hemoglobin. Inheritable mutations can be studied by generating a
   pedigree of a family. Some mutations involve changes in whole set of

                 where there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 and consequently the
                 total number of chromosome becomes 47. In Turner’s syndrome, one X
                 chromosome is missing and the sex chromosome is as XO, and in
                 Klinefelter’s syndrome, the condition is XXY. These can be easily studied
                 by analysis of Karyotypes.

                                  least for the majority of organisms. In class XI you have

      Expression                  (RNA) are the two types of nucleic acids found in living

                                  has additional roles as well. It functions as adapter,
                                  structural, and in some cases as a catalytic molecule. In

                                  nucleotides and the way these monomer units are linked

               of complete nucleotide sequence of human genome during last decade
               has set in a new era of genomics. In the last section, the essentials of
               human genome sequencing and its consequences will also be discussed.
                   Let us begin our discussion by first understanding the structure of
               the most interesting molecule in the living system, that is, the DNA. In
               subsequent sections, we will understand that why it is the most abundant
               genetic material, and what its relationship is with RNA.

               5.1 THE DNA
               DNA is a long polymer of deoxyribonucleotides. The length of DNA is
               usually defined as number of nucleotides (or a pair of nucleotide referred
               to as base pairs) present in it. This also is the characteristic of an organism.
               For example, a bacteriophage known as φ ×174 has 5386 nucleotides,
               Bacteriophage lambda has 48502 base pairs (bp), Escherichia coli has
               4.6 × 106 bp, and haploid content of human DNA is 3.3 × 109 bp. Let us
               discuss the structure of such a long polymer.

               5.1.1 Structure of Polynucleotide Chain
               Let us recapitulate the chemical structure of a polynucleotide chain (DNA
               or RNA). A nucleotide has three components – a nitrogenous base, a
               pentose sugar (ribose in case of RNA, and deoxyribose for DNA), and a
               phosphate group. There are two types of nitrogenous bases – Purines
               (Adenine and Guanine), and Pyrimidines (Cytosine, Uracil and Thymine).
               Cytosine is common for both DNA and RNA and Thymine is present in
               DNA. Uracil is present in RNA at the place of Thymine. A nitrogenous
               base is linked to the OH of 1' C pentose sugar through a N-glycosidic
               linkage to form a nucleoside, such as adenosine or deoxyadenosine,
               guanosine or deoxyguanosine, cytidine or deoxycytidine and uridine or
               deoxythymidine. When a phosphate group is linked to OH of 5' C of a
               nucleoside through phosphoester linkage, a corresponding nucleotide
               (or deoxynucleotide depending upon the type of sugar present) is formed.
               Two nucleotides are linked through 3'-5' phosphodiester linkage to form
               a dinucleotide. More nucleotides can be joined in such a manner to form
               a polynucleotide chain. A polymer thus formed has at one end a free

phosphate moiety at 5' -end of sugar, which is referred to as 5’-end of
polynucleotide chain. Similarly, at the other end of the polymer the sugar
has a free OH of 3' C group which is referred to as 3' - end of the
polynucleotide chain. The backbone of a polynucleotide chain is formed
due to sugar and phosphates. The nitrogenous bases linked to sugar
moiety project from the backbone (Figure 5.1).
    In RNA, every nucleotide residue has an additional –OH group present
at 2' -position in the ribose. Also, in RNA the uracil is found at the place of
thymine (5-methyl uracil, another chemical name for thymine).
    DNA as an acidic substance present in nucleus was first identified by
Friedrich Meischer in 1869. He named it as ‘Nuclein’. However, due to
technical limitation in isolating such a long polymer intact, the elucidation
of structure of DNA remained elusive for a very long period of time. It was
only in 1953 that James Watson and Francis Crick, based on the X-ray
diffraction data produced by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin,
proposed a very simple but famous Double Helix model for the structure
of DNA. One of the hallmarks of their proposition was base pairing between
the two strands of polynucleotide chains. However, this proposition was
also based on the observation of Erwin Chargaff that for a double stranded
DNA, the ratios between Adenine and Thymine and Guanine and Cytosine
are constant and equals one.
    The base pairing confers a very unique property to the polynucleotide
chains. They are said to be complementary to each other, and therefore if
the sequence of bases in one strand is known then the sequence in other
strand can be predicted. Also, if each strand from a DNA (let us call it as a
parental DNA) acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand, the two
double stranded DNA (let us call them as daughter DNA) thus, produced
would be identical to the parental DNA molecule. Because of this, the genetic
implications of the structure of DNA became very clear.
   The salient features of the Double-helix structure of DNA are as follows:
     (i) It is made of two polynucleotide chains, where the backbone is
         constituted by sugar-phosphate, and the bases project inside.
    (ii) The two chains have anti-parallel polarity. It means, if one
         chain has the polarity 5' à3' , the other has 3 ' à5 ' .
   (iii) The bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bond
         (H-bonds) forming base pairs (bp). Adenine forms two hydrogen
         bonds with Thymine from opposite strand and vice-versa.
         Similarly, Guanine is bonded with Cytosine with three H-bonds.
         As a result, always a purine comes opposite to a pyrimidine. This        81
         generates approximately uniform distance between the two
         strands of the helix (Figure 5.2).
   (iv) The two chains are coiled in a right-handed fashion. The pitch
         of the helix is 3.4 nm (a nanometre is one billionth of a
         metre, that is 10-9 m) and there are roughly 10 bp in each

                                                          over the other in double helix. This,
                                                          in addition to H-bonds, confers

   In some viruses the flow of information is in reverse direction, that is,
from RNA to DNA. Can you suggest a simple name to the process?

5.1.2 Packaging of DNA Helix
Taken the distance between two consecutive base pairs
as 0.34 nm (0.34×10–9 m), if the length of DNA double
helix in a typical mammalian cell is calculated (simply
by multiplying the total number of bp with distance
between two consecutive bp, that is, 6.6 × 109 bp ×
0.34 × 10-9 m/bp), it comes out to be approximately
2.2 metres. A length that is far greater than the
dimension of a typical nucleus (approximately 10–6 m).
How is such a long polymer packaged in a cell?
    If the length of E. coli DNA is 1.36 mm, can you
calculate the number of base pairs in E.coli?
    In prokaryotes, such as, E. coli, though they do
not have a defined nucleus, the DNA is not scattered              Figure 5.4a Nucleosome
throughout the cell. DNA (being negatively charged)
is held with some proteins (that have positive
charges) in a region termed as ‘nucleoid’. The DNA
in nucleoid is organised in large loops held by
proteins.
    In eukaryotes, this organisation is much more
complex. There is a set of positively charged, basic
proteins called histones. A protein acquires charge
depending upon the abundance of amino acids
residues with charged side chains. Histones are rich
in the basic amino acid residues lysine and arginine.
Both the amino acid residues carry positive charges Figure 5.4b EM picture - ‘Beads-on-String’
in their side chains. Histones are organised to form
a unit of eight molecules called histone octamer.
The negatively charged DNA is wrapped around the positively charged
histone octamer to form a structure called nucleosome (Figure 5.4 a). A
typical nucleosome contains 200 bp of DNA helix. Nucleosomes constitute
the repeating unit of a structure in nucleus called chromatin, thread-
like stained (coloured) bodies seen in nucleus. The nucleosomes in
chromatin are seen as ‘beads-on-string’ structure when viewed under
electron microscope (EM) (Figure 5.4 b).
    Theoretically, how many such beads (nucleosomes) do you imagine
                                                                                         83
are present in a mammalian cell?
    The beads-on-string structure in chromatin is packaged to form
chromatin fibers that are further coiled and condensed at metaphase stage
of cell division to form chromosomes. The packaging of chromatin at higher
level requires additional set of proteins that collectively are referred to as

               Non-histone Chromosomal (NHC) proteins. In a typical nucleus, some
               region of chromatin are loosely packed (and stains light) and are referred to
               as euchromatin. The chromatin that is more densely packed and stains
               dark are called as Heterochromatin. Euchromatin is said to be
               transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas heterochromatin is inactive.

               5.2 THE SEARCH          FOR    GENETIC MATERIAL
               Even though the discovery of nuclein by Meischer and the proposition
               for principles of inheritance by Mendel were almost at the same time, but
               that the DNA acts as a genetic material took long to be discovered and
               proven. By 1926, the quest to determine the mechanism for genetic
               inheritance had reached the molecular level. Previous discoveries by
               Gregor Mendel, Walter Sutton, Thomas Hunt Morgan and numerous other
               scientists had narrowed the search to the chromosomes located in the
               nucleus of most cells. But the question of what molecule was actually the
               genetic material, had not been answered.

               Transforming Principle
               In 1928, Frederick Griffith, in a series of experiments with Streptococcus
               pneumoniae (bacterium responsible for pneumonia), witnessed a
               miraculous transformation in the bacteria. During the course of his
               experiment, a living organism (bacteria) had changed in physical form.
                   When Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) bacteria are grown
               on a culture plate, some produce smooth shiny colonies (S) while others
               produce rough colonies (R). This is because the S strain bacteria have a
               mucous (polysaccharide) coat, while R strain does not. Mice infected with
               the S strain (virulent) die from pneumonia infection but mice infected

injected a mixture of heat-killed S and live R bacteria, the mice died.
Moreover, he recovered living S bacteria from the dead mice.
    He concluded that the R strain bacteria had somehow been
transformed by the heat-killed S strain bacteria. Some ‘transforming
principle’, transferred from the heat-killed S strain, had enabled the
R strain to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and become virulent.
This must be due to the transfer of the genetic material. However, the
biochemical nature of genetic material was not defined from his
experiments.

Biochemical Characterisation of Transforming Principle
Prior to the work of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty
(1933-44), the genetic material was thought to be a protein. They worked
to determine the biochemical nature of ‘transforming principle’ in Griffith's
experiment.
    They purified biochemicals (proteins, DNA, RNA, etc.) from the
heat-killed S cells to see which ones could transform live R cells into
S cells. They discovered that DNA alone from S bacteria caused R bacteria
to become transformed.
    They also discovered that protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) and
RNA-digesting enzymes (RNases) did not affect transformation, so the
transforming substance was not a protein or RNA. Digestion with DNase
did inhibit transformation, suggesting that the DNA caused the
transformation. They concluded that DNA is the hereditary material, but
not all biologists were convinced.
    Can you think of any difference between DNAs and DNase?

5.2.1 The Genetic Material is DNA
The unequivocal proof that DNA is the genetic material came from the
experiments of Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952). They worked
with viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages.
    The bacteriophage attaches to the bacteria and its genetic material
then enters the bacterial cell. The bacterial cell treats the viral genetic
material as if it was its own and subsequently manufactures more virus
particles. Hershey and Chase worked to discover whether it was protein
or DNA from the viruses that entered the bacteria.
    They grew some viruses on a medium that contained radioactive
phosphorus and some others on medium that contained radioactive sulfur.         85
Viruses grown in the presence of radioactive phosphorus contained
radioactive DNA but not radioactive protein because DNA contains
phosphorus but protein does not. Similarly, viruses grown on radioactive
sulfur contained radioactive protein but not radioactive DNA because
DNA does not contain sulfur.

                   Radioactive phages were allowed to attach to E. coli bacteria. Then, as
               the infection proceeded, the viral coats were removed from the bacteria by
               agitating them in a blender. The virus particles were separated from the
               bacteria by spinning them in a centrifuge.
                   Bacteria which was infected with viruses that had radioactive DNA
               were radioactive, indicating that DNA was the material that passed from
               the virus to the bacteria. Bacteria that were infected with viruses that had
               radioactive proteins were not radioactive. This indicates that proteins did
               not enter the bacteria from the viruses. DNA is therefore the genetic
               material that is passed from virus to bacteria (Figure 5.5).

               From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the debate between proteins
               versus DNA as the genetic material was unequivocally resolved from
               Hershey-Chase experiment. It became an established fact that it is DNA
               that acts as genetic material. However, it subsequently became clear that

MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE

in some viruses, RNA is the genetic material (for example, Tobacco Mosaic
viruses, QB bacteriophage, etc.). Answer to some of the questions such as,
why DNA is the predominant genetic material, whereas RNA performs
dynamic functions of messenger and adapter has to be found from the
differences between chemical structures of the two nucleic acid molecules.
   Can you recall the two chemical differences between DNA and RNA?
    A molecule that can act as a genetic material must fulfill the following
criteria:
       (i) It should be able to generate its replica (Replication).
      (ii) It should be stable chemically and structurally.
     (iii) It should provide the scope for slow changes (mutation) that
           are required for evolution.
     (iv) It should be able to express itself in the form of 'Mendelian
          Characters’.
    If one examines each requirement one by one, because of rule of base
pairing and complementarity, both the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) have
the ability to direct their duplications. The other molecules in the living
system, such as proteins fail to fulfill first criteria itself.
    The genetic material should be stable enough not to change with
different stages of life cycle, age or with change in physiology of the
organism. Stability as one of the properties of genetic material was very
evident in Griffith’s ‘transforming principle’ itself that heat, which killed
the bacteria, at least did not destroy some of the properties of genetic
material. This now can easily be explained in light of the DNA that the
two strands being complementary if separated by heating come together,
when appropriate conditions are provided. Further, 2' -OH group present
at every nucleotide in RNA is a reactive group and makes RNA labile and
easily degradable. RNA is also now known to be catalytic, hence reactive.
Therefore, DNA chemically is less reactive and structurally more stable
when compared to RNA. Therefore, among the two nucleic acids, the DNA
is a better genetic material.
    In fact, the presence of thymine at the place of uracil also confers
additional stability to DNA. (Detailed discussion about this requires
understanding of the process of repair in DNA, and you will study these
processes in higher classes.)
    Both DNA and RNA are able to mutate. In fact, RNA being unstable,
mutate at a faster rate. Consequently, viruses having RNA genome and            87
having shorter life span mutate and evolve faster.
    RNA can directly code for the synthesis of proteins, hence can easily
express the characters. DNA, however, is dependent on RNA for synthesis
of proteins. The protein synthesising machinery has evolved around RNA.
The above discussion indicate that both RNA and DNA can function as

                        genetic material, but DNA being more stable is preferred for storage of
                        genetic information. For the transmission of genetic information, RNA
                        is better.

                        5.3 RNA WORLD
                        From foregoing discussion, an immediate question becomes evident –
                        which is the first genetic material? It shall be discussed in detail in the
                        chapter on chemical evolution, but briefly, we shall highlight some of the
                        facts and points.
                            RNA was the first genetic material. There is now enough evidence to
                        suggest that essential life processes (such as metabolism, translation,
                                            splicing, etc.), evolved around RNA. RNA used to act as
                                            a genetic material as well as a catalyst (there are some
                                            important biochemical reactions in living systems that
                                            are catalysed by RNA catalysts and not by protein
                                            enzymes). But, RNA being a catalyst was reactive and
                                            hence unstable. Therefore, DNA has evolved from RNA
                                            with chemical modifications that make it more stable.
                                            DNA being double stranded and having complementary
                                            strand further resists changes by evolving a process of
                                            repair.

                                             5.4 REPLICATION
                                                While proposing the double helical structure for DNA,
                                                Watson and Crick had immediately proposed a scheme
                                                for replication of DNA. To quote their original statement
                                                that is as follows:
                                                     ‘‘It has not escaped our notice that the specific
                                                pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a
                                                possible copying mechanism for the genetic material’’
                                                (Watson and Crick, 1953).
                                                     The scheme suggested that the two strands would
                                                separate and act as a template for the synthesis of new
Figure 5.6 Watson-Crick model for complementary strands. After the completion of
           se m i c o n s e r v a t i v e D N A replication, each DNA molecule would have one
           replication                          parental and one newly synthesised strand. This
                                                scheme was termed as semiconservative DNA

                        It is now proven that DNA replicates semiconservatively. It was shown first in
                        Escherichia coli and subsequently in higher organisms, such as plants

and human cells. Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl performed the
following experiment in 1958:
      (i) They grew E. coli in a medium containing 15NH4Cl (15N is the heavy
          isotope of nitrogen) as the only nitrogen source for many
          generations. The result was that 15N was incorporated into newly
          synthesised DNA (as well as other nitrogen containing compounds).
          This heavy DNA molecule could be distinguished from the normal
          DNA by centrifugation in a cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient
          (Please note that 15N is not a radioactive isotope, and it can be
          separated from 14N only based on densities).
     (ii) Then they transferred the cells into a medium with normal
          14
            NH4Cl and took samples at various definite time intervals as
          the cells multiplied, and extracted the DNA that remained as
          double-stranded helices. The various samples were separated
          independently on CsCl gradients to measure the densities of
          DNA (Figure 5.7).
         Can you recall what centrifugal force is, and think why a
         molecule with higher mass/density would sediment faster?
         The results are shown in Figure 5.7.

          after 20 minutes; E. coli divides in 20 minutes] had a hybrid or

                         composed of equal amounts of this hybrid DNA and of ‘light’
                         DNA.
               If E. coli was allowed to grow for 80 minutes then what would be the
               proportions of light and hybrid densities DNA molecule?
                   Very similar experiments involving use of radioactive thymidine to
               detect distribution of newly synthesised DNA in the chromosomes was
               performed on Vicia faba (faba beans) by Taylor and colleagues in 1958.
               The experiments proved that the DNA in chromosomes also replicate
               semiconservatively.

               5.4.2 The Machinery and the Enzymes
                In living cells, such as E. coli, the process of replication requires a set of
               catalysts (enzymes). The main enzyme is referred to as DNA-dependent
               DNA polymerase, since it uses a DNA template to catalyse the
               polymerisation of deoxynucleotides. These enzymes are highly efficient
               enzymes as they have to catalyse polymerisation of a large number of
               nucleotides in a very short time. E. coli that has only 4.6 × 106 bp (compare
               it with human whose diploid content is 6.6 × 109 bp), completes the
               process of replication within 18 minutes; that means the average rate of
               polymerisation has to be approximately 2000 bp per second. Not only do
               these polymerases have to be fast, but they also have to catalyse the reaction
               with high degree of accuracy. Any mistake during replication would result
               into mutations. Furthermore, energetically replication is a very expensive
               process. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates serve dual purposes. In
               addition to acting as substrates, they provide energy for polymerisation
               reaction (the two terminal phosphates in a deoxynucleoside triphosphates
               are high-energy phosphates, same as in case of ATP).
                    In addition to DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, many additional
               enzymes are required to complete the process of replication with high
               degree of accuracy. For long DNA molecules, since the two strands of
               DNA cannot be separated in its entire length (due to very high energy
               requirement), the replication occur within a small opening of the DNA
               helix, referred to as replication fork. The DNA-dependent DNA
               polymerases catalyse polymerisation only in one direction, that is 5' à3' .
               This creates some additional complications at the replicating fork.
               Consequently, on one strand (the template with polarity 3' à5' ), the
               replication is continuous, while on the other (the template with
90             polarity 5' à3' ), it is discontinuous. The discontinuously synthesised
               fragments are later joined by the enzyme DNA ligase (Figure 5.8).
                    The DNA polymerases on their own cannot initiate the process of
               replication. Also the replication does not initiate randomly at any place
               in DNA. There is a definite region in E. coli DNA where the replication
               originates. Such regions are termed as origin of replication. It is

MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE

because of the requirement of the origin of
replication that a piece of DNA if needed to be
propagated during recombinant DNA procedures,
requires a vector. The vectors provide the origin of
replication.
    Further, not every detail of replication is
understood well. In eukaryotes, the replication of
DNA takes place at S-phase of the cell-cycle. The
replication of DNA and cell division cycle should be
highly coordinated. A failure in cell division after
DNA replication results into polyploidy(a
chromosomal anomaly). You will learn the detailed
nature of origin and the processes occurring at this
site, in higher classes.

5.5 TRANSCRIPTION
The process of copying genetic information from one
                                                                   Figure 5.8 Replicating Fork
strand of the DNA into RNA is termed as
transcription. Here also, the principle of
complementarity governs the process of transcription, except the adenosine
complements now forms base pair with uracil instead of thymine. However,
unlike in the process of replication, which once set in, the total DNA of an
organism gets duplicated, in transcription only a segment of DNA and
only one of the strands is copied into RNA. This necessitates defining the
boundaries that would demarcate the region and the strand of DNA that
would be transcribed.
    Why both the strands are not copied during transcription has the
simple answer. First, if both strands act as a template, they would code
for RNA molecule with different sequences (Remember complementarity
does not mean identical), and in turn, if they code for proteins, the sequence
of amino acids in the proteins would be different. Hence, one segment of
the DNA would be coding for two different proteins, and this would
complicate the genetic information transfer machinery. Second, the two
RNA molecules if produced simultaneously would be complementary to
each other, hence would form a double stranded RNA. This would prevent
RNA from being translated into protein and the exercise of transcription
would become a futile one.

5.5.1 Transcription Unit                                                                         91
A transcription unit in DNA is defined primarily by the three regions in
the DNA :
   (i) A Promoter
  (ii) The Structural gene
 (iii) A Terminator

                   There is a convention in defining the two strands of the DNA in the
               structural gene of a transcription unit. Since the two strands have opposite
               polarity and the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase also catalyse the
               polymerisation in only one direction, that is, 5' →3' , the strand that has
               the polarity 3' →5' acts as a template, and is also referred to as template
               strand. The other strand which has the polarity (5' →3' ) and the sequence
               same as RNA (except thymine at the place of uracil), is displaced during
               transcription. Strangely, this strand (which does not code for anything)
               is referred to as coding strand. All the reference point while defining a
               transcription unit is made with coding strand. To explain the point, a

                   The promoter and terminator flank the structural gene in a
               transcription unit. The promoter is said to be located towards 5' -end
               (upstream) of the structural gene (the reference is made with respect to
               the polarity of coding strand). It is a DNA sequence that provides binding
               site for RNA polymerase, and it is the presence of a promoter in a
               transcription unit that also defines the template and coding strands. By
               switching its position with terminator, the definition of coding and template
               strands could be reversed. The terminator is located towards 3' -end
               (downstream) of the coding strand and it usually defines the end of the
               process of transcription (Figure 5.9). There are additional regulatory
               sequences that may be present further upstream or downstream to the
92             promoter. Some of the properties of these sequences shall be discussed
               while dealing with regulation of gene expression.

               ambiguity that the genes are located on the DNA, it is difficult to literally

define a gene in terms of DNA sequence. The DNA sequence coding for
tRNA or rRNA molecule also define a gene. However by defining a cistron
as a segment of DNA coding for a polypeptide, the structural gene in a
transcription unit could be said as monocistronic (mostly in eukaryotes)
or polycistronic (mostly in bacteria or prokaryotes). In eukaryotes, the
monocistronic structural genes have interrupted coding sequences – the
genes in eukaryotes are split. The coding sequences or expressed
sequences are defined as exons. Exons are said to be those sequence
that appear in mature or processed RNA. The exons are interrupted by
introns. Introns or intervening sequences do not appear in mature or
processed RNA. The split-gene arrangement further complicates the
definition of a gene in terms of a DNA segment.
    Inheritance of a character is also affected by promoter and regulatory
sequences of a structural gene. Hence, sometime the regulatory sequences
are loosely defined as regulatory genes, even though these sequences do
not code for any RNA or protein.


5.5.3 Types of RNA and the process of Transcription
In bacteria, there are three major types of RNAs: mRNA (messenger RNA),
tRNA (transfer RNA), and rRNA (ribosomal RNA). All three RNAs are
needed to synthesise a protein in a cell. The mRNA provides the template,
tRNA brings aminoacids and reads the genetic code, and rRNAs play
structural and catalytic role during translation. There is single
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that catalyses transcription of all types
of RNA in bacteria. RNA polymerase binds to promoter and initiates
transcription (Initiation). It uses nucleoside triphosphates as substrate

               and polymerises in a template depended fashion following the rule of
               complementarity. It somehow also facilitates opening of the helix and
               continues elongation. Only a short stretch of RNA remains bound to the
               enzyme. Once the polymerases reaches the terminator region, the nascent
               RNA falls off, so also the RNA polymerase. This results in termination of
               transcription.
                   An intriguing question is that how is the RNA polymerases able
               to catalyse all the three steps, which are initiation, elongation and
               termination. The RNA polymerase is only capable of catalysing the
               process of elongation. It associates transiently with initiation-factor (σ)
               and termination-factor (ρ) to initiate and terminate the transcription,
               respectively. Association with these factors alter the specificity of the
               RNA polymerase to either initiate or terminate (Figure 5.10).
                   In bacteria, since the mRNA does not require any processing to become
               active, and also since transcription and translation take place in the same
               compartment (there is no separation of cytosol and nucleus in bacteria),
               many times the translation can begin much before the mRNA is fully
               transcribed. Consequently, the transcription and translation can be coupled
               in bacteria.
                   In eukaryotes, there are two additional complexities –
               (i) There are at least three RNA polymerases in the nucleus (in addition
                   to the RNA polymerase found in the organelles). There is a clear
                   cut division of labour. The RNA polymerase I transcribes rRNAs

     (28S, 18S, and 5.8S), whereas the RNA polymerase III is responsible
     for transcription of tRNA, 5srRNA, and snRNAs (small nuclear
     RNAs). The RNA polymerase II transcribes precursor of mRNA, the
     heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA).
(ii) The second complexity is that the primary transcripts contain both
     the exons and the introns and are non-functional. Hence, it is
     subjected to a process called splicing where the introns are removed
     and exons are joined in a defined order. hnRNA undergoes
     additional processing called as capping and tailing. In capping an
     unusual nucleotide (methyl guanosine triphosphate) is added to
     the 5'-end of hnRNA. In tailing, adenylate residues (200-300) are
     added at 3'-end in a template independent manner. It is the fully
     processed hnRNA, now called mRNA, that is transported out of the
     nucleus for translation (Figure 5.11).
     The significance of such complexities is now beginning to be
understood. The split-gene arrangements represent probably an ancient
feature of the genome. The presence of introns is reminiscent of antiquity,
and the process of splicing represents the dominance of RNA-world. In
recent times, the understanding of RNA and RNA-dependent processes
in the living system have assumed more importance.

5.6 GENETIC CODE
During replication and transcription a nucleic acid was copied to form
another nucleic acid. Hence, these processes are easy to conceptualise
on the basis of complementarity. The process of translation requires
transfer of genetic information from a polymer of nucleotides to synthesise
a polymer of amino acids. Neither does any complementarity exist between
nucleotides and amino acids, nor could any be drawn theoretically. There
existed ample evidences, though, to support the notion that change in
nucleic acids (genetic material) were responsible for change in amino acids
in proteins. This led to the proposition of a genetic code that could direct
the sequence of amino acids during synthesis of proteins.
    If determining the biochemical nature of genetic material and the
structure of DNA was very exciting, the proposition and deciphering of
genetic code were most challenging. In a very true sense, it required
involvement of scientists from several disciplines – physicists, organic
chemists, biochemists and geneticists. It was George Gamow, a physicist,
who argued that since there are only 4 bases and if they have to code for
20 amino acids, the code should constitute a combination of bases. He          95
suggested that in order to code for all the 20 amino acids, the code should
be made up of three nucleotides. This was a very bold proposition, because
a permutation combination of 43 (4 × 4 × 4) would generate 64 codons;
generating many more codons than required.
    Providing proof that the codon was a triplet, was a more daunting
task. The chemical method developed by Har Gobind Khorana was

               instrumental in synthesising RNA molecules with defined combinations
               of bases (homopolymers and copolymers). Marshall Nirenberg’s cell-free
               system for protein synthesis finally helped the code to be deciphered.
               Severo Ochoa enzyme (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was also helpful
               in polymerising RNA with defined sequences in a template independent
               manner (enzymatic synthesis of RNA). Finally a checker-board for genetic
               code was prepared which is given in Table 5.1.
                            Table 5.1: The Codons for the Various Amino Acids




               The salient features of genetic code are as follows:
                       (i) The codon is triplet. 61 codons code for amino acids and 3 codons do
                           not code for any amino acids, hence they function as stop codons.
                      (ii) Some amino acids are coded by more than one codon, hence
                           the code is degenerate.
                    (iii) The codon is read in mRNA in a contiguous fashion. There are
                           no punctuations.
                     (iv) The code is nearly universal: for example, from bacteria to human
                           UUU would code for Phenylalanine (phe). Some exceptions to this
                           rule have been found in mitochondrial codons, and in some
                           protozoans.
                      (v) AUG has dual functions. It codes for Methionine (met) , and it
96                         also act as initiator codon.
                     (vi) UAA, UAG, UGA are stop terminator codons.
                  If following is the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA, predict the
               sequence of amino acid coded by it (take help of the checkerboard):

   Now try the opposite. Following is the sequence of amino acids coded
by an mRNA. Predict the nucleotide sequence in the RNA:

5.6.1 Mutations and Genetic Code
The relationships between genes and DNA are best understood by mutation
studies. You have studied about mutation and its effect in Chapter 4. Effects
of large deletions and rearrangements in a segment of DNA are easy to
comprehend. It may result in loss or gain of a gene and so a function. The
effect of point mutations will be explained here. A classical example of
point mutation is a change of single base pair in the gene for beta globin
chain that results in the change of amino acid residue glutamate to valine.
It results into a diseased condition called as sickle cell anemia. Effect of
point mutations that inserts or deletes a base in structural gene can be
better understood by following simple example.
     Consider a statement that is made up of the following words each
having three letters like genetic code.
   RAM HAS RED CAP
    If we insert a letter B in between HAS and RED and rearrange the
statement, it would read as follows:
   RAM HAS BRE DCA P
   Similarly, if we now insert two letters at the same place, say BI'. Now it
would read,
   RAM HAS BIR EDC AP
   Now we insert three letters together, say BIG, the statement would read
   RAM HAS BIG RED CAP
   The same exercise can be repeated, by deleting the letters R, E and D,
one by one and rearranging the statement to make a triplet word.
   RAM HAS EDC AP
   RAM HAS DCA P
                                                                                97
   RAM HAS CAP
    The conclusion from the above exercise is very obvious. Insertion or
deletion of one or two bases changes the reading frame from the point of
insertion or deletion. However, such mutations are referred to as

                frameshift insertion or deletion mutations. Insertion or deletion of
                three or its multiple bases insert or delete in one or multiple codon hence
                one or multiple amino acids, and reading frame remains unaltered from
                that point onwards.

                5.6.2 tRNA– the Adapter Molecule
                From the very beginning of the proposition of code, it was clear to Francis
                Crick that there has to be a mechanism to read the code and also to link it
                to the amino acids, because amino acids have no structural specialities to
                read the code uniquely. He postulated the presence of an adapter molecule
                that would on one hand read the code and on other hand would bind
                to specific amino acids. The tRNA, then called sRNA (soluble RNA),
                was known before the genetic code was postulated. However, its role
                as an adapter molecule was assigned much later.
                                                                             tRNA has an

            Figure 5.12 tRNA - the adapter molecule                     initiation, there is
                another specific tRNA that is referred to as initiator tRNA. There are no
                tRNAs for stop codons. In figure 5.12, the secondary structure of tRNA
                has been depicted that looks like a clover-leaf. In actual structure, the
                tRNA is a compact molecule which looks like inverted L.

                5.7 TRANSLATION
                Translation refers to the process of polymerisation of amino acids to
                form a polypeptide (Figure 5.13). The order and sequence of amino acids
                are defined by the sequence of bases in the mRNA. The amino acids are
                joined by a bond which is known as a peptide bond. Formation of a
                peptide bond requires energy. Therefore, in the first phase itself amino
98              acids are activated in the presence of ATP and linked to their cognate
                tRNA – a process commonly called as charging of tRNA or
                aminoacylation of tRNA to be more specific. If two such charged tRNAs
                are brought close enough, the formation of peptide bond between them

would be favoured energetically. The
presence of a catalyst would enhance
the rate of peptide bond formation.
    The cellular factory responsible for
synthesising proteins is the ribosome.
The ribosome consists of structural
RNAs and about 80 different proteins.
In its inactive state, it exists as two
subunits; a large subunit and a small
subunit. When the small subunit
encounters an mRNA, the process of
translation of the mRNA to protein
begins. There are two sites in the large
subunit, for subsequent amino acids
to bind to and thus, be close enough                           Figure 5.13 Translation
to each other for the formation of a
peptide bond. The ribosome also acts as a catalyst (23S rRNA in bacteria
is the enzyme- ribozyme) for the formation of peptide bond.
    A translational unit in mRNA is the sequence of RNA that is flanked
by the start codon (AUG) and the stop codon and codes for a polypeptide.
An mRNA also has some additional sequences that are not translated
and are referred as untranslated regions (UTR). The UTRs are present
at both 5' -end (before start codon) and at 3' -end (after stop codon). They
are required for efficient translation process.
    For initiation, the ribosome binds to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG)
that is recognised only by the initiator tRNA. The ribosome proceeds to the
elongation phase of protein synthesis. During this stage, complexes
composed of an amino acid linked to tRNA, sequentially bind to the
appropriate codon in mRNA by forming complementary base pairs with
the tRNA anticodon. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the
mRNA. Amino acids are added one by one, translated into Polypeptide
sequences dictated by DNA and represented by mRNA. At the end, a release
factor binds to the stop codon, terminating translation and releasing the
complete polypeptide from the ribosome.

5.8 REGULATION       OF   GENE EXPRESSION
Regulation of gene expression refers to a very broad term that may occur
at various levels. Considering that gene expression results in the formation
of a polypeptide, it can be regulated at several levels. In eukaryotes, the              99
regulation could be exerted at
   (i) transcriptional level (formation of primary transcript),
  (ii) processing level (regulation of splicing),
 (iii) transport of mRNA from nucleus to the cytoplasm,
 (iv) translational level.

                     The genes in a cell are expressed to perform a particular function or a
                set of functions. For example, if an enzyme called beta-galactosidase is
                synthesised by E. coli, it is used to catalyse the hydrolysis of a
                disaccharide, lactose into galactose and glucose; the bacteria use them
                as a source of energy. Hence, if the bacteria do not have lactose around
                them to be utilised for energy source, they would no longer require the
                synthesis of the enzyme beta-galactosidase. Therefore, in simple terms,
                it is the metabolic, physiological or environmental conditions that regulate
                the expression of genes. The development and differentiation of embryo
                into adult organisms are also a result of the coordinated regulation of
                expression of several sets of genes.
                     In prokaryotes, control of the rate of transcriptional initiation is the
                predominant site for control of gene expression. In a transcription unit,
                the activity of RNA polymerase at a given promoter is in turn regulated
                by interaction with accessory proteins, which affect its ability to recognise
                start sites. These regulatory proteins can act both positively (activators)
                and negatively (repressors). The accessibility of promoter regions of
                prokaryotic DNA is in many cases regulated by the interaction of proteins
                with sequences termed operators. The operator region is adjacent to the
                promoter elements in most operons and in most cases the sequences of
                the operator bind a repressor protein. Each operon has its specific
                operator and specific repressor. For example, lac operator is present
                only in the lac operon and it interacts specifically with lac repressor only.

                5.8.1 The Lac operon
                The elucidation of the lac operon was also a result of a close association
                between a geneticist, Francois Jacob and a biochemist, Jacque Monod. They
                were the first to elucidate a transcriptionally regulated system. In lac operon
                (here lac refers to lactose), a polycistronic structural gene is regulated by a
                common promoter and regulatory genes. Such arrangement is very common
                in bacteria and is referred to as operon. To name few such examples, lac
                operon, trp operon, ara operon, his operon, val operon, etc.
                    The lac operon consists of one regulatory gene (the i gene – here the
                term i does not refer to inducer, rather it is derived from the word inhibitor)
                and three structural genes (z, y, and a). The i gene codes for the repressor
                of the lac operon. The z gene codes for beta-galactosidase (β-gal), which
                is primarily responsible for the hydrolysis of the disaccharide, lactose
100             into its monomeric units, galactose and glucose. The y gene codes for
                permease, which increases permeability of the cell to β-galactosides. The
                a gene encodes a transacetylase. Hence, all the three gene products in
                lac operon are required for metabolism of lactose. In most other operons
                as well, the genes present in the operon are needed together to function
                in the same or related metabolic pathway (Figure 5.14).

    Lactose is the substrate for the enzyme beta-galactosidase and it
regulates switching on and off of the operon. Hence, it is termed as inducer.
In the absence of a preferred carbon source such as glucose, if lactose is
provided in the growth medium of the bacteria, the lactose is transported
into the cells through the action of permease (Remember, a very low level
of expression of lac operon has to be present in the cell all the time,
otherwise lactose cannot enter the cells). The lactose then induces the
operon in the following manner.
    The repressor of the operon is synthesised (all-the-time – constitutively)
from the i gene. The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the
operon and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon. In
the presence of an inducer, such as lactose or allolactose, the repressor is
inactivated by interaction with the inducer. This allows RNA polymerase
access to the promoter and transcription proceeds (Figure 5.14).
Essentially, regulation of lac operon can also be visualised as regulation
of enzyme synthesis by its substrate.
    Remember, glucose or galactose cannot act as inducers for lac
                                                                                 101
operon. Can you think for how long the lac operon would be expressed
in the presence of lactose?
    Regulation of lac operon by repressor is referred to as negative
regulation. Lac operon is under control of positive regulation as well,
but it is beyond the scope of discussion at this level.

                5.9 HUMAN GENOME PROJECT
                In the preceding sections you have learnt that it is the sequence of bases in
                DNA that determines the genetic information of a given organism. In other
                words, genetic make-up of an organism or an individual lies in the DNA
                sequences. If two individuals differ, then their DNA sequences should also
                be different, at least at some places. These assumptions led to the quest of
                finding out the complete DNA sequence of human genome. With the
                establishment of genetic engineering techniques where it was possible to
                isolate and clone any piece of DNA and availability of simple and fast
                techniques for determining DNA sequences, a very ambitious project of
                sequencing human genome was launched in the year 1990.
                    Human Genome Project (HGP) was called a mega project. You can
                imagine the magnitude and the requirements for the project if we simply
                define the aims of the project as follows:
                    Human genome is said to have approximately 3 x 109 bp, and if the
                cost of sequencing required is US $ 3 per bp (the estimated cost in the
                beginning), the total estimated cost of the project would be approximately
                9 billion US dollars. Further, if the obtained sequences were to be stored
                in typed form in books, and if each page of the book contained 1000
                letters and each book contained 1000 pages, then 3300 such books would
                be required to store the information of DNA sequence from a single human
                cell. The enormous amount of data expected to be generated also
                necessitated the use of high speed computational devices for data storage
                and retrieval, and analysis. HGP was closely associated with the rapid
                development of a new area in biology called Bioinformatics.

                Goals of HGP
                Some of the important goals of HGP were as follows:
                    (i) Identify all the approximately 20,000-25,000 genes in human DNA;
                   (ii) Determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that
                        make up human DNA;
                  (iiii) Store this information in databases;
                   (iv) Improve tools for data analysis;
                   (v) Transfer related technologies to other sectors, such as industries;
                   (vi) Address the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) that may arise
                        from the project.
                    The Human Genome Project was a 13-year project coordinated by
102             the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health. During
                the early years of the HGP, the Wellcome Trust (U.K.) became a major
                partner; additional contributions came from Japan, France, Germany,
                China and others. The project was completed in 2003. Knowledge about
                the effects of DNA variations among individuals can lead to revolutionary
                new ways to diagnose, treat and someday prevent the thousands of

disorders that affect human beings. Besides providing clues to
understanding human biology, learning about non-human organisms
DNA sequences can lead to an understanding of their natural capabilities
that can be applied toward solving challenges in health care, agriculture,
energy production, environmental remediation. Many non-human model
organisms, such as bacteria, yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans (a free living
non-pathogenic nematode), Drosophila (the fruit fly), plants (rice and
Arabidopsis), etc., have also been sequenced.
Methodologies : The methods involved two major approaches. One
approach focused on identifying all the genes that are expressed as
RNA (referred to as Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The other took
the blind approach of simply sequencing the whole set of genome that
contained all the coding and non-coding sequence, and later assigning
different regions in the sequence with functions (a term referred to as
Sequence Annotation). For sequencing, the total DNA from a cell is
isolated and converted into random fragments of relatively smaller sizes
(recall DNA is a very long polymer, and there are technical limitations in
sequencing very long pieces of DNA) and cloned in suitable host using
specialised vectors. The cloning resulted into amplification of each piece
of DNA fragment so that it subsequently could be sequenced with ease.
The commonly used hosts were bacteria and yeast, and the vectors were
called as BAC (bacterial artificial chromosomes), and YAC (yeast artificial
chromosomes).
    The fragments were sequenced using automated DNA sequencers that
worked on the principle of a method developed by Frederick Sanger.
(Remember, Sanger is also credited for developing method for
determination of amino acid
sequences in proteins). These
sequences were then arranged based
on some overlapping regions
present in them. This required
generation of overlapping fragments
for sequencing. Alignment of these
sequences was humanly not
possible. Therefore, specialised
computer based programs were
developed (Figure 5.15). These
sequences were subsequently
annotated and were assigned to each
                                                                                         103
chromosome. The sequence of
chromosome 1 was completed only
in May 2006 (this was the last of the
24 human chromosomes – 22                Figure 5.15 A representative diagram of human

                physical maps on the genome. This was generated using information on
                polymorphism of restriction endonuclease recognition sites, and some
                repetitive DNA sequences known as microsatellites (one of the applications
                of polymorphism in repetitive DNA sequences shall be explained in next
                section of DNA fingerprinting).

                5.9.1 Salient Features of Human Genome
                Some of the salient observations drawn from human genome project are
                as follows:
                   (i) The human genome contains 3164.7 million bp.
                   (ii) The average gene consists of 3000 bases, but sizes vary greatly, with
                        the largest known human gene being dystrophin at 2.4 million bases.
                  (iii) The total number of genes is estimated at 30,000– much lower
                        than previous estimates of 80,000 to 1,40,000 genes. Almost all
                        (99.9 per cent) nucleotide bases are exactly the same in all people.
                  (iv) The functions are unknown for over 50 per cent of the discovered
                       genes.
                   (v) Less than 2 per cent of the genome codes for proteins.
                  (vi) Repeated sequences make up very large portion of the human genome.
                 (vii) Repetitive sequences are stretches of DNA sequences that are
                       repeated many times, sometimes hundred to thousand times. They
                       are thought to have no direct coding functions, but they shed light
                       on chromosome structure, dynamics and evolution.
                 (viii) Chromosome 1 has most genes (2968), and the Y has the fewest (231).
                  (ix) Scientists have identified about 1.4 million locations where single-
                       base DNA differences (SNPs – single nucleotide polymorphism,
                       pronounced as ‘snips’) occur in humans. This information promises
                       to revolutionise the processes of finding chromosomal locations for
                       disease-associated sequences and tracing human history.

                5.9.2 Applications and Future Challenges
                Deriving meaningful knowledge from the DNA sequences will define
                research through the coming decades leading to our understanding of
                biological systems. This enormous task will require the expertise and
104             creativity of tens of thousands of scientists from varied disciplines in both
                the public and private sectors worldwide. One of the greatest impacts of
                having the HG sequence may well be enabling a radically new approach
                to biological research. In the past, researchers studied one or a few genes
                at a time. With whole-genome sequences and new high-throughput
                technologies, we can approach questions systematically and on a much

broader scale. They can study all the genes in a genome, for example, all
the transcripts in a particular tissue or organ or tumor, or how tens of
thousands of genes and proteins work together in interconnected networks
to orchestrate the chemistry of life.

5.10 DNA FINGERPRINTING
As stated in the preceding section, 99.9 per cent of base sequence among
humans is the same. Assuming human genome as 3 × 109 bp, in how
many base sequences would there be differences? It is these differences
in sequence of DNA which make every individual unique in their
phenotypic appearance. If one aims to find out genetic differences
between two individuals or among individuals of a population,
sequencing the DNA every time would be a daunting and expensive
                                                           6
task. Imagine trying to compare two sets of 3 × 10 base pairs. DNA
fingerprinting is a very quick way to compare the DNA sequences of any
two individuals.
    DNA fingerprinting involves identifying differences in some specific
regions in DNA sequence called as repetitive DNA, because in these
sequences, a small stretch of DNA is repeated many times. These repetitive
DNA are separated from bulk genomic DNA as different peaks during
density gradient centrifugation. The bulk DNA forms a major peak and
the other small peaks are referred to as satellite DNA. Depending on
base composition (A : T rich or G:C rich), length of segment, and number
of repetitive units, the satellite DNA is classified into many categories,
such as micro-satellites, mini-satellites etc. These sequences normally
do not code for any proteins, but they form a large portion of human
genome. These sequence show high degree of polymorphism and form
the basis of DNA fingerprinting. Since DNA from every tissue (such as
blood, hair-follicle, skin, bone, saliva, sperm etc.), from an individual
show the same degree of polymorphism, they become very useful
identification tool in forensic applications. Further, as the polymorphisms
are inheritable from parents to children, DNA fingerprinting is the basis
of paternity testing, in case of disputes.
    As polymorphism in DNA sequence is the basis of genetic mapping
of human genome as well as of DNA fingerprinting, it is essential that we
understand what DNA polymorphism means in simple terms.
Polymorphism (variation at genetic level) arises due to mutations. (Recall
different kind of mutations and their effects that you have already
studied in Chapter 4, and in the preceding sections in this chapter.)         105
New mutations may arise in an individual either in somatic cells or in
the germ cells (cells that generate gametes in sexually reproducing
organisms). If a germ cell mutation does not seriously impair individual’s
ability to have offspring who can transmit the mutation, it can spread to

                the other members of population (through sexual reproduction). Allelic
                (again recall the definition of alleles from Chapter 4) sequence variation
                has traditionally been described as a DNA polymorphism if more than
                one variant (allele) at a locus occurs in human population with a
                frequency greater than 0.01. In simple terms, if an inheritable mutation
                is observed in a population at high frequency, it is referred to as DNA
                polymorphism. The probability of such variation to be observed in non-
                coding DNA sequence would be higher as mutations in these sequences
                may not have any immediate effect/impact in an individual’s
                reproductive ability. These mutations keep on accumulating generation
                after generation, and form one of the basis of variability/polymorphism.
                There is a variety of different types of polymorphisms ranging from single
                nucleotide change to very large scale changes. For evolution and
                speciation, such polymorphisms play very important role, and you will
                study these in details at higher classes.
                    The technique of DNA Fingerprinting was initially developed by Alec
                Jeffreys. He used a satellite DNA as probe that shows very high degree
                of polymorphism. It was called as Variable Number of Tandem Repeats
                (VNTR). The technique, as used earlier, involved Southern blot
                hybridisation using radiolabelled VNTR as a probe. It included
                  (i) isolation of DNA,
                 (ii) digestion of DNA by restriction endonucleases,
                (iii) separation of DNA fragments by electrophoresis,
                (iv) transferring (blotting) of separated DNA fragments to synthetic
                     membranes, such as nitrocellulose or nylon,
                 (v) hybridisation using labelled VNTR probe, and
                 (vi) detection of hybridised DNA fragments by autoradiography. A schematic
                      representation of DNA fingerprinting is shown in Figure 5.16.
                    The VNTR belongs to a class of satellite DNA referred to as mini-satellite.
                A small DNA sequence is arranged tandemly in many copy numbers. The
                copy number varies from chromosome to chromosome in an individual.
                The numbers of repeat show very high degree of polymorphism. As a
                result the size of VNTR varies in size from 0.1 to 20 kb. Consequently,
                after hybridisation with VNTR probe, the autoradiogram gives many bands
                of differing sizes. These bands give a characteristic pattern for an individual
106             DNA (Figure 5.16). It differs from individual to individual in a population
                except in the case of monozygotic (identical) twins. The sensitivity of the
                technique has been increased by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR–
                you will study about it in Chapter 9). Consequently, DNA from a single
                cell is enough to perform DNA fingerprinting analysis. In addition to
                application in forensic science, it has much wider application, such as

                                                  SUMMARY
                  Nucleic acids are long polymers of nucleotides. While DNA stores genetic
                  information, RNA mostly helps in transfer and expression of information.
                  Though DNA and RNA both function as genetic material, but DNA being
                  chemically and structurally more stable is a better genetic material.
                  However, RNA is the first to evolve and DNA was derived from RNA. The
                  hallmark of the double stranded helical structure of DNA is the hydrogen
                  bonding between the bases from opposite strands. The rule is that
                  Adenine pairs with Thymine through two H-bonds, and Guanine with
                  Cytosine through three H-bonds.              This makes one strand
                  complementary to the other. The DNA replicates semiconservatively,
                  the process is guided by the complementary H-bonding. A segment of
                  DNA that codes for RNA may in a simplistic term can be referred as
                  gene. During transcription also, one of the strands of DNA acts a
                  template to direct the synthesis of complementary RNA. In bacteria,
                  the transcribed mRNA is functional, hence can directly be translated.
                  In eukaryotes, the gene is split. The coding sequences, exons, are
                  interrupted by non-coding sequences, introns. Introns are removed
                  and exons are joined to produce functional RNA by splicing. The
                  messenger RNA contains the base sequences that are read in a
                  combination of three (to make triplet genetic code) to code for an amino
                  acid. The genetic code is read again on the principle of complementarity
                  by tRNA that acts as an adapter molecule. There are specific tRNAs for
                  every amino acid. The tRNA binds to specific amino acid at one end
                  and pairs through H-bonding with codes on mRNA through its
                  anticodons. The site of translation (protein synthesis) is ribosomes,
                  which bind to mRNA and provide platform for joining of amino acids.
                  One of the rRNA acts as a catalyst for peptide bond formation, which is
                  an example of RNA enzyme (ribozyme). Translation is a process that
                  has evolved around RNA, indicating that life began around RNA. Since,
                  transcription and translation are energetically very expensive
                  processes, these have to be tightly regulated. Regulation of transcription
                  is the primary step for regulation of gene expression. In bacteria, more
                  than one gene is arranged together and regulated in units called as
                  operons. Lac operon is the prototype operon in bacteria, which codes
                  for genes responsible for metabolism of lactose. The operon is regulated
                  by the amount of lactose in the medium where the bacteria are grown.
                  Therefore, this regulation can also be viewed as regulation of enzyme
                  synthesis by its substrate.
                      Human genome project was a mega project that aimed to sequence
                  every base in human genome. This project has yielded much new
108               information. Many new areas and avenues have opened up as a
                  consequence of the project. DNA Fingerprinting is a technique to find
                  out variations in individuals of a population at DNA level. It works on
                  the principle of polymorphism in DNA sequences. It has immense
                  applications in the field of forensic science, genetic biodiversity and
                  evolutionary biology.

        Man                           way, looking back in time. Stellar distances are measured
                                      in light years. What we see today is an object whose emitted
                                      light started its journey millions of year back and from
                                      trillions of kilometres away and reaching our eyes now.
                                      However, when we see objects in our immediate
 110                                  surroundings we see them instantly and hence in the
                                      present time. Therefore, when we see stars we apparently
                                      are peeping into the past.
                                           The origin of life is considered a unique event in the
                                      history of universe. The universe is vast. Relatively speaking
                                      the earth itself is almost only a speck. The universe is very

old – almost 20 billion years old. Huge clusters of galaxies comprise the
universe. Galaxies contain stars and clouds of gas and dust. Considering
the size of universe, earth is indeed a speck. The Big Bang theory attempts
to explain to us the origin of universe. It talks of a singular huge explosion
unimaginable in physical terms. The universe expanded and hence, the
temperature came down. Hydrogen and Helium formed sometime later.
The gases condensed under gravitation and formed the galaxies of the
present day universe. In the solar system of the milky way galaxy, earth
was supposed to have been formed about 4.5 billion years back. There
was no atmosphere on early earth. Water vapour, methane, carbondioxide
and ammonia released from molten mass covered the surface. The UV rays
from the sun brokeup water into Hydrogen and Oxygen and the lighter H2
escaped. Oxygen combined with ammonia and methane to form water,
CO2 and others. The ozone layer was formed. As it cooled, the water vapor
fell as rain, to fill all the depressions and form oceans. Life appeared 500
million years after the formation of earth, i.e., almost four billion years back.
     Did life come from outerspace? Some scientists believe that it came
from outside. Early Greek thinkers thought units of life called spores
were transferred to different planets including earth. ‘Panspermia’ is still
a favourite idea for some astronomers. For a long time it was also believed
that life came out of decaying and rotting matter like straw, mud, etc.
This was the theory of spontaneous generation. Louis Pasteur by careful
experimentation demonstrated that life comes only from pre-existing life.
He showed that in pre-sterilised flasks, life did not come from killed yeast
while in another flask open to air, new living organisms arose from ‘killed
yeast’. Spontaneous generation theory was dismissed once and for all.
However, this did not answer how the first life form came on earth.
     Oparin of Russia and Haldane of England proposed that the first form
of life could have come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules
(e.g. RNA, protein, etc.) and that formation of life was preceded by chemical
evolution, i.e., formation of diverse organic molecules from inorganic
constituents. The conditions on earth were – high temperature, volcanic
storms, reducing atmosphere containing CH4, NH3, etc. In 1953, S.L. Miller,
an American scientist created similar conditions in a laboratory scale
(Figure 6.1). He created electric discharge in a closed flask containing
CH4, H2, NH3 and water vapour at 8000C. He observed formation of amino
acids. In similar experiments others observed, formation of sugars,
nitrogen bases, pigment and fats. Analysis of meteorite content also
revealed similar compounds indicating that similar processes are                    111
occurring elsewhere in space. With this limited evidence, the first part of
the conjectured story, i.e., chemical evolution was more or less accepted.
     We have no idea about how the first self replicating metabolic capsule
of life arose. The first non-cellular forms of life could have originated
3 billion years back. They would have been giant molecules (RNA, Protein,

                Polysaccharides, etc.). These capsules reproduced their molecules perhaps.
                The first cellular form of life did not possibly originate till about 2000
                million years ago. These were probably single-cells. All life forms were in
                water environment only. This version of a biogenesis, i.e., the first form of
                life arose slowly through evolutionary forces from non-living molecules is
                accepted by majority. However, once formed, how the first cellular forms
                of life could have evolved into the complex biodiversity of today is the
                fascinating story that will be discussed below.

                6.2 EVOLUTION       OF   LIFE FORMS – A THEORY
                Conventional religious literature tells us about the theory of special
                creation. This theory has three connotations. One, that all living organisms
                (species or types) that we see today were created as such. Two, that the
                diversity was always the same since creation and will be the same in future
                also. Three, that earth is about 4000 years old. All these ideas were
                strongly challenged during the nineteenth century. Based on observations
                made during a sea voyage in a sail ship called H.M.S. Beagle round the
112             world, Charles Darwin concluded that existing living forms share
                similarities to varying degrees not only among themselves but also with
                life forms that existed millions of years ago. Many such life forms do not
                exist any more. There had been extinctions of different life forms in the
                years gone by just as new forms of life arose at different periods of history
                of earth. There has been gradual evolution of life forms. Any population

has built in variation in characteristics. Those characteristics which enable
some to survive better in natural conditions (climate, food, physical factors,
etc.) would outbreed others that are less-endowed to survive under such
natural conditions. Another word used is fitness of the individual or
population. The fitness, according to Darwin, refers ultimately and only
to reproductive fitness. Hence, those who are better fit in an environment,
leave more progeny than others. These, therefore, will survive more and
hence are selected by nature. He called it natural selection and implied it
as a mechanism of evolution. Let us also remember that Alfred Wallace, a
naturalist who worked in Malay Archipelago had also come to similar
conclusions around the same time. In due course of time, apparently new
types of organisms are recognisable. All the existing life forms share
similarities and share common ancestors. However, these ancestors were
present at different periods in the history of earth (epochs, periods and
eras). The geological history of earth closely correlates with the biological
history of earth. A common permissible conclusion is that earth is very
old, not thousand of years as was thought earlier but billions of years old.

6.3 WHAT ARE       THE   EVIDENCES FOR EVOLUTION?
Evidence that evolution of life forms has indeed taken place on earth has
come from many quarters. Fossils are remains of hard parts of
life-forms found in rocks. Rocks form sediments and a cross-section of
earth's crust indicates the arrangement of sediments one over the other
during the long history of earth. Different-aged rock sediments contain
fossils of different life-forms who probably died during the formation of
the particular sediment. Some of them appear similar to modern
organisms (Figure 6.2). They represent extinct organisms (e.g., Dinosaurs).
A study of fossils in different sedimentary layers indicates the geological
period in which they existed. The study showed that life-forms varied
over time and certain life forms are restricted to certain geological time-
spans. Hence, new forms of life have arisen at different times in the history
of earth. All this is called paleontological evidence. Do you remember how
the ages of the fossils are calculated? Do you recollect the method of
radioactive-dating and the principles behind the procedure?
     Embryological support for evolution was also proposed by Ernst
Heckel based upon the observation of certain features during embryonic
stage common to all vertebrates that are absent in adult. For example,
the embryos of all vertebrates including human develop a row of vestigial
gill slit just behind the head but it is a functional organ only in fish and     113
not found in any other adult vertebrates. However, this proposal was
disapproved on careful study performed by Karl Ernst von Baer. He noted
that embryos never pass through the adult stages of other animals.
     Comparative anatomy and morphology shows similarities and
differences among organisms of today and those that existed years ago.

            crocodiles and birds

                      Such similarities can be interpreted to understand whether common
                      ancestors were shared or not. For example whales, bats, Cheetah and
                      human (all mammals) share similarities in the pattern of bones of forelimbs
114                   (Figure 6.3b). Though these forelimbs perform different functions in these
                      animals, they have similar anatomical structure – all of them have
                      humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges in their
                      forelimbs. Hence, in these animals, the same structure developed along
                      different directions due to adaptations to different needs. This is divergent
                      evolution and these structures are homologous. Homology indicates
                      common ancestry. Other examples are vertebrate hearts or brains. In

plants also, the thorn and tendrils of
Bougainvillea and Cucurbita represent
homology (Figure 6.3a). Homology is
based on divergent evolution whereas
                                                                                       Tendril
analogy refers to a situation exactly
opposite. Wings of butterfly and of birds
look alike. They are not anatomically
similar structures though they perform
similar functions. Hence, analogous
structures are a result of convergent
evolution - different structures evolving
for the same function and hence having                                   (a)
similarity. Other examples of analogy are
the eye of the octopus and of mammals
or the flippers of Penguins and Dolphins.
One can say that it is the similar habitat
that has resulted in selection of similar
adaptive features in different groups of
organisms but toward the same function:
Sweet potato (root modification) and
potato (stem modification) is another
example for analogy.
     In the same line of argument,
similarities in proteins and genes
performing a given function among diverse
organisms give clues to common ancestry.
These biochemical similarities point to the
same shared ancestry as structural
similarities among diverse organisms.
     Man has bred selected plants and
animals for agriculture, horticulture, sport
or security. Man has domesticated many
wild animals and crops. This intensive                                   (b)
breeding programme has created breeds           Figure 6.3 Example of homologous organs in
that differ from other breeds (e.g., dogs) but              (a) Plants and (b) Animals
still are of the same group. It is argued that
if within hundreds of years, man could create new breeds, could not nature
have done the same over millions of years?
     Another interesting observation supporting evolution by natural                       115
selection comes from England. In a collection of moths made in 1850s,
i.e., before industrialisation set in, it was observed that there were more
white-winged moths on trees than dark-winged or melanised moths.
However, in the collection carried out from the same area, but after
industrialisation, i.e., in 1920, there were more dark-winged moths in
the same area, i.e., the proportion was reversed.

                          The explanation put forth for this observation was that ‘predators will
                      spot a moth against a contrasting background’. During post-
                      industrialisation period, the tree trunks became dark due to industrial
                      smoke and soots. Under this condition the white-winged moth did not
                      survive due to predators, dark-winged or melanised moth survived. Before
                      industrialisation set in, thick growth of almost white-coloured lichen
                      covered the trees - in that background the white winged moth survived
                      but the dark-coloured moth were picked out by predators. Do you know
                      that lichens can be used as industrial pollution indicators? They will
                      not grow in areas that are polluted. Hence, moths that were able to
                      camouflage themselves, i.e., hide in the background, survived
                      (Figure 6.4). This understanding is supported by the fact that in areas
                      where industrialisation did not occur e.g., in rural areas, the count of
                      melanic moths was low. This showed that in a mixed population, those
                      that can better-adapt, survive and increase in population size. Remember
                      that no variant is completely wiped out.
                          Similarly, excess use of herbicides, pesticides, etc., has only resulted in
                      selection of resistant varieties in a much lesser time scale. This is also true for
                      microbes against which we employ antibiotics or drugs against eukaryotic
                      organisms/cell. Hence, resistant organisms/cells are appearing in a time
                      scale of months or years and not centuries. These are examples of evolution
                      by anthropogenic action. This also tells us that evolution is not a directed
                      process in the sense of determinism. It is a stochastic process based on
                      chance events in nature and chance mutation in the organisms.

                      During his journey Darwin went to Galapagos Islands. There he observed
                      an amazing diversity of creatures. Of particular interest, small black birds
                      later called Darwin’s Finches amazed him. He realised that there were many

varieties of finches in the same island. All the varieties, he conjectured,
evolved on the island itself. From the original seed-eating features, many
other forms with altered beaks arose, enabling them to become insectivorous
and vegetarian finches (Figure 6.5). This process of evolution of different
species in a given geographical area starting from a point and literally
radiating to other areas of geography (habitats) is called adaptive radiation.
Darwin’s finches represent one of the best examples of this phenomenon.
Another example is Australian marsupials. A number of marsupials, each
different from the other (Figure 6.6) evolved from an ancestral stock, but all
within the Australian island continent. When more than one adaptive radiation
appeared to have occurred in an isolated geographical area (representing

                                                     Evolution by natural selection, in a true sense
                                                     would have started when cellular forms of life
                                                     with differences in metabolic capability
                                                     originated on earth.
                                                         The essence of Darwinian theory about
                                                     evolution is natural selection. The rate of
                                                     appearance of new forms is linked to the life cycle
                                                     or the life span. Microbes that divide fast have
                                                     the ability to multiply and become millions of
                                                     individuals within hours. A colony of bacteria
                                                     (say A) growing on a given medium has built-in
                                                     variation in terms of ability to utilise a feed
                                                     component. A change in the medium
                                                     composition would bring out only that part of
                                                     the population (say B) that can survive under
                                                     the new conditions. In due course of time this
                                                     variant population outgrows the others and
                                                     appears as new species. This would happen
                                                     within days. For the same thing to happen in a
                                                     fish or fowl would take million of years as life
                                                     spans of these animals are in years. Here we say
                                                     that fitness of B is better than that of A under

              of Australian Marsupials and
              placental mammals                      One must remember that the so-called fitness is
                                                     based on characteristics which are inherited.
                         Hence, there must be a genetic basis for getting selected and to evolve.
                         Another way of saying the same thing is that some organisms are better
                         adapted to survive in an otherwise hostile environment. Adaptive ability is
118                      inherited. It has a genetic basis. Fitness is the end result of the ability to
                         adapt and get selected by nature.
                             Branching descent and natural selection are the two key concepts
                         of Darwinian Theory of Evolution (Figures 6.7 and 6.8).
                             Even before Darwin, a French naturalist Lamarck had said that
                         evolution of life forms had occurred but driven by use and disuse of

organs. He gave the examples of Giraffes who in an attempt to forage
leaves on tall trees had to adapt by elongation of their necks. As they
passed on this acquired character of elongated neck to succeeding
generations, Giraffes, slowly, over the years, came to acquire long necks.
Nobody believes this conjecture any more.
    Is evolution a process or the result of a process? The world we see,
inanimate and animate, is only the success stories of evolution. When we
describe the story of this world we describe evolution as a process. On the
other hand when we describe the story of life on earth, we treat evolution
as a consequence of a process called natural selection. We are still not
very clear whether to regard evolution and natural selection as processes
or end result of unknown processes.
    It is possible that the work of Thomas Malthus on populations
influenced Darwin. Natural selection is based on certain observations
which are factual. For example, natural resources are limited, populations
are stable in size except for seasonal fluctuation, members of a population
vary in characteristics (infact no two individuals are alike) even though
they look superficially similar, most of variations are inherited etc. The
fact that theoretically population size will grow exponentially if everybody
reproduced maximally (this fact can be seen in a growing bacterial
population) and the fact that population sizes in reality are limited, means
that there had been competition for resources. Only some survived and
grew at the cost of others that could not flourish. The novelty and brilliant
insight of Darwin was this: he asserted that variations, which are heritable
and which make resource utilisation better for few (adapted to habitat
better) will enable only those to reproduce and leave more progeny. Hence
for a period of time, over many generations, survivors will leave more
progeny and there would be a change in population characteristic and
hence new forms appear to arise.

6.6 MECHANISM        OF   EVOLUTION
What is the origin of this variation and how does speciation occur? Even
though Mendel had talked of inheritable 'factors' influencing phenotype,
Darwin either ignored these observations or kept silence. In the first decade
of twentieth century, Hugo deVries based on his work on evening primrose
brought forth the idea of mutations – large difference arising suddenly in
a population. He believed that it is mutation which causes evolution and
                                                                                119
not the minor variations (heritable) that Darwin talked about. Mutations
are random and directionless while Darwinian variations are small and
directional. Evolution for Darwin was gradual while deVries believed
mutation caused speciation and hence called it saltation (single step
large mutation). Studies in population genetics, later, brought out
some clarity.

                     6.7 HARDY-WEINBERG PRINCIPLE
                     In a given population one can find out the frequency of occurrence of
                     alleles of a gene or a locus. This frequency is supposed to remain fixed
                     and even remain the same through generations. Hardy-Weinberg principle
                     stated it using algebraic equations.
                         This principle says that allele frequencies in a population are stable
                     and is constant from generation to generation. The gene pool (total genes
                     and their alleles in a population) remains a constant. This is called
                     genetic equilibrium. Sum total of all the allelic frequencies is 1. Individual

frequencies, for example, can be named p, q, etc. In a diploid, p and q
represent the frequency of allele A and allele a . The frequency of AA
individuals in a population is simply p2. This is simply stated in another
ways, i.e., the probability that an allele A with a frequency of p appear on
both the chromosomes of a diploid individual is simply the product
of the probabilities, i.e., p2. Similarly of aa is q2, of Aa 2pq. Hence,
p2+2pq+q2=1. This is a binomial expansion of (p+q)2. When frequency
measured, differs from expected values, the difference (direction) indicates
the extent of evolutionary change. Disturbance in genetic equilibrium, or
Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium, i.e., change of frequency of alleles in a
population would then be interpreted as resulting in evolution.
     Five factors are known to affect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These
are gene migration or gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, genetic
recombination and natural selection. When migration of a section of
population to another place and population occurs, gene frequencies
change in the original as well as in the new population. New genes/alleles
are added to the new population and these are lost from the old population.
There would be a gene flow if this gene migration, happens multiple times.
If the same change occurs by chance, it is called genetic drift. Sometimes
the change in allele frequency is so different in the new sample of population
that they become a different species. The original drifted population
becomes founders and the effect is called founder effect.
     Microbial experiments show that pre-existing advantageous
mutations when selected will result in observation of new phenotypes.
Over few generations, this would result in Speciation. Natural selection is
a process in which heritable variations enabling better survival are enabled
to reproduce and leave greater number of progeny. A critical analysis
makes us believe that variation due to mutation or variation due to
recombination during gametogenesis, or due to gene flow or genetic drift
results in changed frequency of genes and alleles in future generation.
Coupled to enhance reproductive success, natural selection makes it look
like different population. Natural selection can lead to stabilisation (in
which more individuals acquire mean character value), directional change
(more individuals acquire value other than the mean character value) or
disruption (more individuals acquire peripheral character value at both
ends of the distribution curve) (Figure 6.8).

                   appropriate light harvesting pigments. Slowly single-celled organisms
                   became multi-cellular life forms. By the time of 500 mya, invertebrates
                   were formed and active. Jawless fish probably evolved around 350 mya.
122                Sea weeds and few plants existed probably around 320 mya. We are told
                   that the first organisms that invaded land were plants. They were
                   widespread on land when animals invaded land. Fish with stout and strong
                   fins could move on land and go back to water. This was about 350 mya. In

of these left with us. However, these were ancestors of modern day frogs
and salamanders. The amphibians evolved into reptiles. They lay thick-

Again we only see their modern day descendents, the turtles, tortoises
and crocodiles. In the next 200 millions years or so, reptiles of different

                shapes and sizes dominated on earth. Giant ferns (pteridophytes) were
                present but they all fell to form coal deposits slowly. Some of these land
                reptiles went back into water to evolve into fish like reptiles probably 200
                mya (e.g. Ichthyosaurs). The land reptiles were, of course, the dinosaurs.
                The biggest of them, i.e., Tyrannosaurus rex was about 20 feet in height
                and had huge fearsome dagger like teeth. About 65 mya, the dinosaurs
                suddenly disappeared from the earth. We do not know the true reason.
                Some say climatic changes killed them. Some say most of them evolved
                into birds. The truth may live in between. Small sized reptiles of that era
                still exist today.
                     The first mammals were like shrews. Their fossils are small sized.
                Mammals were viviparous and protected their unborn young inside the
                mother’s body. Mammals were more intelligent in sensing and avoiding
                danger at least. When reptiles came down mammals took over this earth.
                There were in South America mammals resembling horse, hippopotamus,
                bear, rabbit, etc. Due to continental drift, when South America joined
                North America, these animals were overridden by North American fauna.
                Due to the same continental drift pouched mammals of Australia survived
                because of lack of competition from any other mammal.
                     Lest we forget, some mammals live wholly in water. Whales, dolphins,
                seals and sea cows are some examples. Evolution of horse, elephant, dog,
                etc., are special stories of evolution. You will learn about these in higher
                classes. The most successful story is the evolution of man with language
                skills and self-consciousness.
                     A rough sketch of the evolution of life forms, their times on a geological
                scale are indicated in (Figures 6.9 and 6.10).

                6.9 ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF MAN
                About 15 mya, primates called Dryopithecus and Ramapithecus were
                existing. They were hairy and walked like gorillas and chimpanzees.
                Ramapithecus was more man-like while Dryopithecus was more
                ape-like. Few fossils of man-like bones have been discovered in Ethiopia
                and Tanzania (Figure 6.11). These revealed hominid features leading to
                the belief that about 3-4 mya, man-like primates walked in eastern Africa.
                They were probably not taller than 4 feet but walked up right. Two mya,
                Australopithecines probably lived in East African grasslands. Evidence
124             shows they hunted with stone weapons but essentially ate fruit. Some of
                the bones among the bones discovered were different. This creature was
                called the first human-like being the hominid and was called Homo habilis.
                The brain capacities were between 650-800cc. They probably did not eat
                meat. Fossils discovered in Java in 1891 revealed the next stage, i.e., Homo
                erectus about 1.5 mya. Homo erectus had a large brain around 900cc.

            adult chimpanzee. The skull of baby chimpanzee is more like adult human skull
            than adult chimpanzee skull


Homo erectus probably ate meat. The Neanderthal man with a brain size
of 1400cc lived in near east and central Asia between 1,00,000-40,000
years back. They used hides to protect their body and buried their dead.
Homo sapiens arose in Africa and moved across continents and developed
into distinct races. During ice age between 75,000-10,000 years ago
                                                                                     125
modern Homo sapiens arose. Pre-historic cave art developed about
18,000 years ago. One such cave paintings by Pre-historic humans can
be seen at Bhimbetka rock shelter in Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh.
Agriculture came around 10,000 years back and human settlements
started. The rest of what happened is part of human history of growth
and decline of civilisations.

                                                  SUMMARY
                 The origin of life on earth can be understood only against the
                 background of origin of universe especially earth. Most scientists
                 believe chemical evolution, i.e., formation of biomolecules preceded
                 the appearance of the first cellular forms of life. The subsequent events
                 as to what happened to the first form of life is a conjectured story
                 based on Darwinian ideas of organic evolution by natural selection.
                 Diversity of life forms on earth has been changing over millions of
                 years. It is generally believed that variations in a population result in
                 variable fitness. Other phenomena like habitat fragmentation and
                 genetic drift may accentuate these variations leading to appearance
                 of new species and hence evolution. Homology is accounted for by the
                 idea of branching descent. Study of comparative anatomy, fossils and
                 comparative biochemistry provides evidence for evolution. Among the
                 stories of evolution of individual species, the story of evolution of
                 modern man is most interesting and appears to parallel evolution of
                 human brain and language.

HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE


7.1   Common Diseases in
      Humans
7.2   Immunity
                                   Health, for a long time, was considered as a state of body
                                   and mind where there was a balance of certain ‘humors’.
7.3   AIDS                         This is what early Greeks like Hippocrates as well as
7.4   Cancer                       Indian Ayurveda system of medicine asserted. It was
                                   thought that persons with ‘blackbile’ belonged to hot
7.5   Drugs and Alcohol Abuse
                                   personality and would have fevers. This idea was arrived
                                   at by pure reflective thought. The discovery of blood
                                   circulation by William Harvey using experimental method
                                   and the demonstration of normal body temperature in
                                   persons with blackbile using thermometer disproved the
                                   ‘good humor’ hypothesis of health. In later years, biology
                                   stated that mind influences, through neural system and
                                   endocrine system, our immune system and that our
                                   immune system maintains our health. Hence, mind and
                                   mental state can affect our health. Of course, health is
                                   affected by –
                                      (i) genetic disorders – deficiencies with which a child is
                                          born and deficiencies/defects which the child inherits
                                          from parents from birth;
                                     (ii) infections and
                                    (iii) life style including food and water we take, rest and
                                          exercise we give to our bodies, habits that we have or
                                          lack etc.

                    The term health is very frequently used by everybody. How do we
                define it? Health does not simply mean ‘absence of disease’ or ‘physical
                fitness’. It could be defined as a state of complete physical, mental and
                social well-being. When people are healthy, they are more efficient at
                work. This increases productivity and brings economic prosperity. Health
                also increases longevity of people and reduces infant and maternal
                mortality.
                    Balanced diet, personal hygiene and regular exercise are very important
                to maintain good health. Yoga has been practised since time immemorial
                to achieve physical and mental health. Awareness about diseases and
                their effect on different bodily functions, vaccination (immunisation)
                against infectious diseases, proper disposal of wastes, control of vectors
                and maintenance of hygiene in food and water resources are necessary
                for achieving good health.
                    When the functioning of one or more organs or systems of the body is
                adversely affected, characterised by appearance of various signs and
                symptoms, we say that we are not healthy, i.e., we have a disease. Diseases
                can be broadly grouped into infectious and non-infectious. Diseases
                which are easily transmitted from one person to another, are called
                infectious diseases. Infectious diseases are very common and every
                one of us suffers from these at sometime or other. Some of the infectious
                diseases like AIDS are fatal. Among non-infectious diseases, cancer is the
                major cause of death. Drug and alcohol abuse also affect our health adversely.

                7.1 COMMON DISEASES               IN   HUMANS
                A wide range of organisms belonging to bacteria, viruses, fungi,
                protozoans, helminths, etc., could cause diseases in man. Such disease-
                causing organisms are called pathogens. Most parasites are therefore
                pathogens as they cause harm to the host by living in (or on) them. The
                pathogens can enter our body by various means, multiply and interfere
                with normal vital activities, resulting in morphological and functional
                damage. Pathogens have to adapt to life within the environment of the
                host. For example, the pathogens that enter the gut must know a way of
                surviving in the stomach at low pH and resisting the various digestive
                enzymes. A few representative members from different groups of
                pathogenic organisms are discussed here alongwith the diseases caused
                by them. Preventive and control measures against these diseases in general,
                are also briefly described.
130                 Salmonella typhi is a pathogenic bacterium which causes typhoid
                fever in human beings. These pathogens generally enter the small intestine
                through food and water contaminated with them and migrate to other
                organs through blood. Sustained high fever (39° to 40°C), weakness,
                stomach pain, constipation, headache and loss of appetite are some of
                the common symptoms of this disease. Intestinal perforation and death
                may occur in severe cases. Typhoid fever could be confirmed by

HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE


Widal test : A classic case in medicine, that of Mary Mallon nicknamed
Typhoid Mary, is worth mentioning here. She was a cook by profession
and was a typhoid carrier who continued to spread typhoid for several
years through the food she prepared.
    Bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae
are responsible for the disease pneumonia in humans which infects the
alveoli (air filled sacs) of the lungs. As a result of the infection, the alveoli
get filled with fluid leading to severe problems in respiration. The symptoms
of pneumonia include fever, chills, cough and headache. In severe cases,
the lips and finger nails may turn gray to bluish in colour. A healthy
person acquires the infection by inhaling the droplets/aerosols released
by an infected person or even by sharing glasses and utensils with an
infected person. Dysentery, plague, diphtheria, etc., are some of the other
bacterial diseases in man.
    Many viruses also cause diseases in human beings. Rhino viruses
represent one such group of viruses which cause one of the most infectious
human ailments – the common cold. They infect the nose and respiratory
passage but not the lungs. The common cold is characterised by nasal
congestion and discharge, sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache,
tiredness, etc., which usually last for 3-7 days. Droplets resulting from
cough or sneezes of an infected person are either inhaled directly or
transmitted through contaminated objects such as pens, books, cups,
doorknobs, computer keyboard or mouse, etc., and cause infection in a
healthy person.
    Some of the human diseases are caused by protozoans too. You might
have heard about malaria, a disease man has been fighting since many
years. Plasmodium, a tiny protozoan is responsible for this disease. Different
species of Plasmodium (P. vivax, P. malaria and P. falciparum) are
responsible for different types of malaria. Of these, malignant malaria caused
by Plasmodium falciparum is the most serious one and can even be fatal.
    Let us take a glance at the life cycle of Plasmodium (Figure 7.1).
Plasmodium enters the human body as sporozoites (infectious form)
through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquito. The parasites
initially multiply within the liver cells and then attack the red blood cells
(RBCs) resulting in their rupture. The rupture of RBCs is associated with
release of a toxic substance, haemozoin, which is responsible for the chill
and high fever recurring every three to four days. When a female Anopheles
mosquito bites an infected person, these parasites enter the mosquito’s
body and undergo further development. The parasites multiply within
them to form sporozoites that are stored in their salivary glands. When
                                                                                    131
these mosquitoes bite a human, the sporozoites are introduced into his/
her body, thereby initiating the events mentioned above. It is interesting
to note that the malarial parasite requires two hosts – human and
mosquitoes – to complete its life cycle (Figure 7.1); the female Anopheles
mosquito is the vector (transmitting agent) too.

and food products, thereby contaminating them.
Drinking water and food contaminated by the faecal
matter are the main source of infection.
    Ascaris, the common round worm and Wuchereria,
the filarial worm, are some of the helminths which are
known to be pathogenic to man. Ascaris, an intestinal
parasite causes ascariasis. Symptoms of these disease
include internal bleeding, muscular pain, fever, anemia
and blockage of the intestinal passage. The eggs of the
parasite are excreted along with the faeces of infected
persons which contaminate soil, water, plants, etc. A
healthy person acquires this infection through
contaminated water, vegetables, fruits, etc.
    Wuchereria (W. bancrofti and W. malayi), the filarial
worms cause a slowly developing chronic inflammation
of the organs in which they live for many years, usually
the lymphatic vessels of the lower limbs and the disease
is called elephantiasis or filariasis (Figure 7.2). The
genital organs are also often affected, resulting in gross
deformities. The pathogens are transmitted to a healthy         Figure 7.2      Diagram showing
person through the bite by the female mosquito vectors.                         inflammation in one

T richophyton and Epidermophyton are
responsible for ringworms which is one of
the most common infectious diseases in man.
Appearance of dry, scaly lesions on various
parts of the body such as skin, nails and
scalp (Figure 7.3) are the main symptoms of
the disease. These lesions are accompanied
by intense itching. Heat and moisture help
these fungi to grow, which makes them thrive
in skin folds such as those in the groin or
between the toes. Ringworms are generally              Figure 7.3 Diagram showing ringworm
acquired from soil or by using towels, clothes                    affected area of the skin
or even the comb of infected individuals.
    Maintenance of personal and public hygiene is very important for
prevention and control of many infectious diseases. Measures for personal
hygiene include keeping the body clean; consumption of clean drinking
water, food, vegetables, fruits, etc. Public hygiene includes proper disposal                    133
of waste and excreta; periodic cleaning and disinfection of water reservoirs,
pools, cesspools and tanks and observing standard practices of hygiene
in public catering. These measures are particularly essential where the
infectious agents are transmitted through food and water such as typhoid,
amoebiasis and ascariasis. In cases of air-borne diseases such as
pneumonia and common cold, in addition to the above measures, close

                contact with the infected persons or their belongings should be avoided.
                For diseases such as malaria and filariasis that are transmitted through
                insect vectors, the most important measure is to control or eliminate the
                vectors and their breeding places. This can be achieved by avoiding
                stagnation of water in and around residential areas, regular cleaning of
                household coolers, use of mosquito nets, introducing fishes like Gambusia
                in ponds that feed on mosquito larvae, spraying of insecticides in ditches,
                drainage areas and swamps, etc. In addition, doors and windows should
                be provided with wire mesh to prevent the entry of mosquitoes. Such
                precautions have become more important especially in the light of recent
                widespread incidences of the vector-borne (Aedes mosquitoes) diseases
                like dengue and chikungunya in many parts of India.
                    The advancements made in biological science have armed us to
                effectively deal with many infectious diseases. The use of vaccines and
                immunisation programmes have enabled us to completely eradicate a
                deadly disease like smallpox. A large number of other infectious diseases
                like polio, diphtheria, pneumonia and tetanus have been controlled to a
                large extent by the use of vaccines. Biotechnology (about which you will
                read more in Chapter 10) is at the verge of making available newer and
                safer vaccines. Discovery of antibiotics and various other drugs has also
                enabled us to effectively treat infectious diseases.

                7.2 IMMUNITY
                Everyday we are exposed to large number of infectious agents. However,
                only a few of these exposures result in disease. Why? This is due to the
                fact that the body is able to defend itself from most of these foreign agents.
                This overall ability of the host to fight the disease-causing organisms,
                conferred by the immune system is called immunity.
                    Immunity is of two types: (i) Innate immunity and (ii) Acquired
                immunity.

                7.2.1 Innate Immunity
                Innate immunity is non-specific type of defence, that is present at the
                time of birth. This is accomplished by providing different types of barriers
                to the entry of the foreign agents into our body. Innate immunity consist
                of four types of barriers. These are —
                   (i) Physical barriers : Skin on our body is the main barrier which
                       prevents entry of the micro-organisms. Mucus coating of the
134                    epithelium lining the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital
                       tracts also help in trapping microbes entering our body.
                  (ii) Physiological barriers : Acid in the stomach, saliva in the mouth,
                       tears from eyes–all prevent microbial growth.
                 (iii) Cellular barriers : Certain types of leukocytes (WBC) of our body
                       like polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes (PMNL-neutrophils) and

      monocytes and natural killer (type of lymphocytes) in the blood as
      well as macrophages in tissues can phagocytose and destroy
      microbes.
 (iv) Cytokine barriers : Virus-infected cells secrete proteins called
      interferons which protect non-infected cells from further viral
      infection.

7.2.2 Acquired Immunity
Acquired immunity, on the other hand is pathogen specific. It is
characterised by memory. This means when our body encounters a
pathogen for the first time it produces a response called primary
response which is of low intensity. Subsequent encounter with the same
pathogen elicits a highly intensified secondary or anamnestic response.
This is ascribed to the fact that our body appears to have memory of the
first encounter.
    The primary and secondary
immune         responses        are
carried out with the help
of two special types of
lymphocytes present in our
blood, i.e., B-lymphocytes and
T-lymphocytes.
    The B-lymphocytes produce an
army of proteins in response to
pathogens into our blood to fight
with them. These proteins are
called      antibodies.         The
T-cells themselves do not secrete
antibodies but help B cells to
produce them. Each antibody
molecule has four peptide chains,
two small called light chains and
two longer called heavy chains.                 Figure 7.4 Structure of an antibody molecule
Hence, an antibody is represented
as H2L2. Different types of antibodies are produced in our body. IgA, IgM,
IgE, IgG are some of them. A cartoon of an antibody is given in Figure
7.4. Because these antibodies are found in the blood, the response is also
called as humoral immune response. This is one of the two types of our
acquired immune response – antibody mediated. The second type is called                        135
cell-mediated immune response or cell-mediated immunity (CMI). The
T-lymphocytes mediate CMI. Very often, when some human organs like
heart, eye, liver, kidney fail to function satisfactorily, transplantation is
the only remedy to enable the patient to live a normal life. Then a search
begins – to find a suitable donor. Why is it that the organs cannot be
taken from just anybody? What is it that the doctors check? Grafts from

                                                                                     BIOLOGY


                just any source – an animal, another primate, or any human beings cannot
                be made since the grafts would be rejected sooner or later. Tissue
                matching, blood group matching are essential before undertaking any
                graft/transplant and even after this the patient has to take immuno–
                suppresants all his/her life. The body is able to differentiate ‘self ’ and
                ‘nonself’ and the cell-mediated immune response is responsible for the
                graft rejection.

                7.2.3 Active and Passive Immunity
                When a host is exposed to antigens, which may be in the form of living
                or dead microbes or other proteins, antibodies are produced in the host
                body. This type of immunity is called active immunity. Active immunity
                is slow and takes time to give its full effective response. Injecting the
                microbes deliberately during immunisation or infectious organisms
                gaining access into body during natural infection induce active
                immunity. When ready-made antibodies are directly given to protect
                the body against foreign agents, it is called passive immunity. Do you
                know why mother’s milk is considered very essential for the new-
                born infant? The yellowish fluid colostrum secreted by mother during
                the initial days of lactation has abundant antibodies (IgA) to protect the
                infant. The foetus also receives some antibodies from their mother,
                through the placenta during pregnancy. These are some examples of
                passive immunity.

                7.2.4 Vaccination and Immunisation
                The principle of immunisation or vaccination is based on the property of
                ‘memory’ of the immune system. In vaccination, a preparation of antigenic
                proteins of pathogen or inactivated/weakened pathogen (vaccine) are
                introduced into the body. The antibodies produced in the body against
                these antigens would neutralise the pathogenic agents during actual
                infection. The vaccines also generate memory – B and T-cells that recognise
                the pathogen quickly on subsequent exposure and overwhelm the
                invaders with a massive production of antibodies. If a person is infected
                with some deadly microbes to which quick immune response is required
                as in tetanus, we need to directly inject the preformed antibodies, or
                antitoxin (a preparation containing antibodies to the toxin). Even in cases
                of snakebites, the injection which is given to the patients, contain preformed
136             antibodies against the snake venom. This type of immunisation is called
                passive immunisation.
                     Recombinant DNA technology has allowed the production of antigenic
                polypeptides of pathogen in bacteria or yeast. Vaccines produced using
                this approach allow large scale production and hence greater availability
                for immunisation, e.g., hepatitis B vaccine produced from yeast.

HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE


7.2.5 Allergies
When you have gone to a new place and suddenly you started sneezing,
wheezing for no explained reason, and when you went away, your
symptoms dissappeared. Did this happen to you? Some of us are sensitive
to some particles in the environment. The above-mentioned reaction could
be because of allergy to pollen, mites, etc., which are different in different
places.
     The exaggerated response of the immune system to certain antigens
present in the environment is called allergy. The substances to which
such an immune response is produced are called allergens. The antibodies
produced to these are of IgE type. Common examples of allergens are
mites in dust, pollens, animal dander, etc. Symptoms of allergic reactions
include sneezing, watery eyes, running nose and difficulty in breathing.
Allergy is due to the release of chemicals like histamine and serotonin
from the mast cells. For determining the cause of allergy, the patient is
exposed to or injected with very small doses of possible allergens, and the
reactions studied. The use of drugs like anti-histamine, adrenalin and
steroids quickly reduce the symptoms of allergy. Somehow, modern-day
life style has resulted in lowering of immunity and more sensitivity to
allergens – more and more children in metro cities of India suffer from
allergies and asthma due to sensitivity to the environment. This could be
because of the protected environment provided early in life.

7.2.6 Auto Immunity
Memory-based acquired immunity evolved in higher vertebrates based
on the ability to differentiate foreign organisms (e.g., pathogens) from self-
cells. While we still do not understand the basis of this, two corollaries of
this ability have to be understood. One, higher vertebrates can distinguish
foreign molecules as well as foreign organisms. Most of the experimental
immunology deals with this aspect. Two, sometimes, due to genetic and
other unknown reasons, the body attacks self-cells. This results in damage
to the body and is called auto-immune disease. Rheumatoid arthritis
which affects many people in our society is an auto-immune disease.

7.2.7 Immune System in the Body
The human immune system consists of lymphoid organs, tissues, cells
and soluble molecules like antibodies. As you have read, immune system
is unique in the sense that it recognises foreign antigens, responds to
                                                                                 137
these and remembers them. The immune system also plays an important
role in allergic reactions, auto-immune diseases and organ
transplantation.
Lymphoid organs: These are the organs where origin and/or maturation
and proliferation of lymphocytes occur. The primary lymphoid organs
are bone marrow and thymus where immature lymphocytes differentiate

                                 into antigen-sensitive lymphocytes. After maturation the
                                 lymphocytes migrate to secondary lymphoid organs like spleen,
                                 lymph nodes, tonsils, Peyer’s patches of small intestine and
                                 appendix. The secondary lymphoid organs provide the sites for
                                 interaction of lymphocytes with the antigen, which then proliferate
                                 to become effector cells. The location of various lymphoid organs
                                 in the human body is shown in Figure 7.5.
                                     The bone marrow is the main lymphoid organ where all
                                 blood cells including lymphocytes are produced. The thymus
                                 is a lobed organ located near the heart and beneath the
                                 breastbone. The thymus is quite large at the time of birth but
                                 keeps reducing in size with age and by the time puberty is
                                 attained it reduces to a very small size. Both bone-marrow
                                 and thymus provide micro-environments for the development
                                 and maturation of T-lymphocytes. The spleen is a large bean-
                                 shaped organ. It mainly contains lymphocytes and phagocytes.

                                 The lymph nodes are small solid structures located at different
                      points along the lymphatic system. Lymph nodes serve to trap the
                      micro-organisms or other antigens, which happen to get into the lymph
                      and tissue fluid. Antigens trapped in the lymph nodes are responsible for
                      the activation of lymphocytes present there and cause the immune
                      response.
                          There is lymphoid tissue also located within the lining of the major
                      tracts (respiratory, digestive and urogenital tracts) called mucosa-
                      associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). It constitutes about 50 per cent of
                      the lymphoid tissue in human body.

                     7.3 AIDS
                     The word AIDS stands for Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome.
                     This means deficiency of immune system, acquired during the lifetime of
                     an individual indicating that it is not a congenital disease. ‘Syndrome’
                     means a group of symptoms. AIDS was first reported in 1981 and in the
                     last twenty-five years or so, it has spread all over the world killing more
                     than 25 million persons.
                         AIDS is caused by the Human Immuno deficiency Virus (HIV), a
                     member of a group of viruses called retrovirus, which have an envelope

transfusion? Find out and make a list of such conditions. It is important      139
to note that HIV/AIDS is not spread by mere touch or physical contact; it
spreads only through body fluids. It is, hence, imperative, for the physical
and psychological well-being, that the HIV/AIDS infected persons are
not isolated from family and society. There is always a time-lag between
the infection and appearance of AIDS symptoms. This period may vary
from a few months to many years (usually 5-10 years).

                     After getting into the body of the person, the virus enters into macrophages
                where RNA genome of the virus replicates to form viral DNA with the help of
                the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This viral DNA gets incorporated into host
                cell’s DNA and directs the infected cells to produce virus particles (Figure 7.6).
                The macrophages continue to produce virus and in this way acts like a HIV
                factory. Simultaneously, HIV enters into helper T-lymphocytes (TH), replicates
                and produce progeny viruses. The progeny viruses released in the blood attack
                other helper T-lymphocytes. This is repeated leading to a progressive decrease
                in the number of helper T-lymphocytes in the body of the infected person.
                During this period, the person suffers from bouts of fever, diarrhoea and weight
                loss. Due to decrease in the number of helper T lymphocytes, the person starts
                suffering from infections that could have been otherwise overcome such as
                those due to bacteria especially Mycobacterium, viruses, fungi and even
                parasites like Toxoplasma. The patient becomes so immuno-deficient that
                he/she is unable to protect himself/herself against these infections. A widely
                used diagnostic test for AIDS is enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay
                (ELISA). Treatment of AIDS with anti-retroviral drugs is only partially effective.
                They can only prolong the life of the patient but cannot prevent death, which is
                inevitable.
                Prevention of AIDS : As AIDS has no cure, prevention is the best option.
                Moreover, HIV infection, more often, spreads due to conscious behaviour
                patterns and is not something that happens inadvertently, like pneumonia
                or typhoid. Of course, infection in blood transfusion patients, new-borns
                (from mother) etc., may take place due to poor monitoring. The only excuse
                may be ignorance and it has been rightly said – “don’t die of ignorance”.
                In our country the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and other
                non-governmental organisation (NGOs) are doing a lot to educate people
                about AIDS. WHO has started a number of programmes to prevent the
                spreading of HIV infection. Making blood (from blood banks) safe from
                HIV, ensuring the use of only disposable needles and syringes in public
                and private hospitals and clinics, free distribution of condoms, controlling
                drug abuse, advocating safe sex and promoting regular check-ups for
                HIV in susceptible populations, are some such steps taken up.
                    Infection with HIV or having AIDS is something that should not be
                hidden – since then, the infection may spread to many more people.
                HIV/AIDS-infected people need help and sympathy instead of being
                shunned by society. Unless society recognises it as a problem to be dealt
                with in a collective manner – the chances of wider spread of the disease
140             increase manifold. It is a malady that can only be tackled, by the society
                and medical fraternity acting together, to prevent the spread of the disease.

cancer and a large number of them die from it annually. The mechanisms
that underlie development of cancer or oncogenic transformation of cells,
its treatment and control have been some of the most intense areas of
research in biology and medicine.
    In our body, cell growth and differentiation is highly controlled and
regulated. In cancer cells, there is breakdown of these regulatory
mechanisms. Normal cells show a property called contact inhibition by
virtue of which contact with other cells inhibits their uncontrolled growth.
Cancer cells appears to have lost this property. As a result of this, cancerous
cells just continue to divide giving rise to masses of cells called tumors.
Tumors are of two types: benign and malignant. Benign tumors normally
remain confined to their original location and do not spread to other parts
of the body and cause little damage. The malignant tumors, on the
other hand are a mass of proliferating cells called neoplastic or tumor
cells. These cells grow very rapidly, invading and damaging the
surrounding normal tissues. As these cells actively divide and grow they
also starve the normal cells by competing for vital nutrients. Cells sloughed
from such tumors reach distant sites through blood, and wherever they
get lodged in the body, they start a new tumor there. This property called
metastasis is the most feared property of malignant tumors.
Causes of cancer : Transformation of normal cells into cancerous
neoplastic cells may be induced by physical, chemical or biological agents.
These agents are called carcinogens. Ionising radiations like X-rays and
gamma rays and non-ionizing radiations like UV cause DNA damage
leading to neoplastic transformation. The chemical carcinogens present
in tobacco smoke have been identified as a major cause of lung cancer.
Cancer causing viruses called oncogenic viruses have genes called viral
oncogenes. Furthermore, several genes called cellular oncogenes
(c-onc) or proto oncogenes have been identified in normal cells which,
when activated under certain conditions, could lead to oncogenic
transformation of the cells.
Cancer detection and diagnosis : Early detection of cancers is essential
as it allows the disease to be treated successfully in many cases. Cancer
detection is based on biopsy and histopathological studies of the tissue
and blood and bone marrow tests for increased cell counts in the case of
leukemias. In biopsy, a piece of the suspected tissue cut into thin sections
is stained and examined under microscope (histopathological studies) by
a pathologist. Techniques like radiography (use of X-rays), CT (computed
tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) are very useful to               141
detect cancers of the internal organs. Computed tomography uses X-rays
to generate a three-dimensional image of the internals of an object. MRI
uses strong magnetic fields and non-ionising radiations to accurately detect
pathological and physiological changes in the living tissue.
    Antibodies against cancer -specific antigens are also used for
detection of certain cancers. Techniques of molecular biology can be

                  applied to detect genes in individuals with inherited susceptibility to
                  certain cancers. Identification of such genes, which predispose an
                  individual to certain cancers, may be very helpful in prevention of
                  cancers. Such individuals may be advised to avoid exposure to
                  particular carcinogens to which they are susceptible (e.g., tobacco
                  smoke in case of lung cancer).
                  Treatment of cancer : The common approaches for treatment of cancer
                  are surgery, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. In radiotherapy,
                  tumor cells are irradiated lethally, taking proper care of the normal tissues
                  surrounding the tumor mass. Several chemotherapeutic drugs are used
                  to kill cancerous cells. Some of these are specific for particular tumors.
                  Majority of drugs have side effects like hair loss, anemia, etc. Most cancers
                  are treated by combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
                  Tumor cells have been shown to avoid detection and destruction by
                  immune system. Therefore, the patients are given substances called
                  biological response modifiers such as α-interferon which activates their
                  immune system and helps in destroying the tumor.

                  7.5 DRUGS      AND    ALCOHOL ABUSE
                  Surveys and statistics show that use of drugs and alcohol has been on
                  the rise especially among the youth. This is really a cause of concern as it
                  could result in many harmful effects. Proper education and guidance
                  would enable youth to safeguard themselves against these dangerous
                  behaviour patterns and follow healthy lifestyles.
                      The drugs, which are commonly abused are opioids, cannabinoids
                  and coca alkaloids. Majority of these are obtained from flowering plants.
                  Some are obtained from fungi.
                      Opioids are the drugs, which bind to specific opioid receptors present
                  in our central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Heroin
                  (Figure 7.7), commonly called smack is chemically diacetylmorphine which
                  is a white, odourless, bitter crystalline compound. This is obtained by
                  acetylation of morphine (Figure 7.7), which is extracted from the latex of

poppy plant Papaver somniferum (Figure 7.8). Generally taken by snorting
and injection, heroin is a depressant and slows down body functions.
    Cannabinoids are a group of chemicals (Figure 7.9), which interact
with cannabinoid receptors present principally in the brain. Natural
cannabinoids are obtained from the inflorescences of the plant Cannabis
sativa (Figure 7.10). The flower tops, leaves and the resin of cannabis
plant are used in various combinations to produce marijuana, hashish,
charas and ganja. Generally taken by inhalation and oral ingestion, these
are known for their effects on cardiovascular system of the body.

    Coca alkaloid or cocaine is obtained from coca
plant Erythroxylum coca, native to South America. It
interferes with the transport of the neuro-transmitter
dopamine. Cocaine, commonly called coke or crack is
usually snorted. It has a potent stimulating action on
central nervous system, producing a sense of euphoria
and increased energy. Excessive dosage of cocaine
causes hallucinations. Other well-known plants with
hallucinogenic properties are Atropa belladona and
Datura (Figure 7.11). These days cannabinoids are also
being abused by some sportspersons.

benzodiazepines, and other similar drugs, that are
normally used as medicines to help patients cope with         Figure 7.11 Flowering branch of Datura
mental illnesses like depression and insomnia, are often
abused. Morphine is a very effective sedative and painkiller, and is very useful                143
in patients who have undergone surgery. Several plants, fruits and seeds
having hallucinogenic properties have been used for hundreds of years in
folk-medicine, religious ceremonies and rituals all over the globe. When these
are taken for a purpose other than medicinal use or in amounts/frequency
that impairs one’s physical, physiological or psychological functions, it
constitutes drug abuse.

                    Smoking also paves the way to hard drugs. Tobacco has been used
                by human beings for more than 400 years. It is smoked, chewed or used
                as a snuff. Tobacco contains a large number of chemical substances
                including nicotine, an alkaloid. Nicotine stimulates adrenal gland to
                release adrenaline and nor-adrenaline into blood circulation, both of
                which raise blood pressure and increase heart rate. Smoking is associated
                with increased incidence of cancers of lung, urinary bladder and throat,
                bronchitis, emphysema, coronary heart disease, gastric ulcer, etc. Tobacco
                chewing is associated with increased risk of cancer of the oral cavity.
                Smoking increases carbon monoxide (CO) content in blood and reduces
                the concentration of haembound oxygen. This causes oxygen deficiency
                in the body.
                    When one buys packets of cigarettes one cannot miss the statutory
                warning that is present on the packing which warns against smoking
                and says how it is injurious to health. Yet, smoking is very prevalent in
                society, both among young and old. Knowing the dangers of smoking
                and chewing tobacco, and its addictive nature, the youth and old need to
                avoid these habits. Any addict requires counselling and medical help to
                get rid of the habit.

                7.5.1 Adolescence and Drug/Alcohol Abuse
                Adolescence means both ‘a period’ and ‘a process’ during which a child
                becomes mature in terms of his/her attitudes and beliefs for effective
                participation in society. The period between 12-18 years of age may
                be thought of as adolescence period. In other words, adolescence is a
                bridge linking childhood and adulthood. Adolescence is accompanied
                by several biological and behavioural changes. Adolescence, thus is a
                very vulnerable phase of mental and psychological development of an
                individual.
                    Curiosity, need for adventure and excitement, and experimentation,
                constitute common causes, which motivate youngsters towards drug
                and alcohol use. A child’s natural curiosity motivates him/her to
                experiment. This is complicated further by effects that might be perceived
                as benefits, of alcohol or drug use. Thus, the first use of drugs or alcohol
                may be out of curiosity or experimentation, but later the child starts
                using these to escape facing problems. Of late, stress, from pressures to
                excel in academics or examinations, has played a significant role in
                persuading the youngsters to try alcohol and drugs. The perception
144             among youth that it is ‘cool’ or progressive to smoke, use drugs or
                alcohol, is also in a way a major cause for youth to start these habits.
                Television, movies, newspapers, internet also help to promote this
                perception. Other factors that have been seen to be associated with drug
                and alcohol abuse among adolescents are unstable or unsupportive
                family structures and peer pressure.

HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE


7.5.2 Addiction and Dependence
Because of the perceived benefits, drugs are frequently used repeatedly.
The most important thing, which one fails to realise, is the inherent
addictive nature of alcohol and drugs. Addiction is a psychological
attachment to certain effects – such as euphoria and a temporary feeling
of well-being – associated with drugs and alcohol. These drive people to
take them even when these are not needed, or even when their use becomes
self-destructive. With repeated use of drugs, the tolerance level of the
receptors present in our body increases. Consequently the receptors
respond only to higher doses of drugs or alcohol leading to greater intake
and addiction. However, it should be clearly borne in mind that use of
these drugs even once, can be a fore-runner to addiction. Thus, the
addictive potential of drugs and alcohol, pull the user into a vicious circle
leading to their regular use (abuse) from which he/she may not be able
to get out. In the absence of any guidance or counselling, the person gets
addicted and becomes dependent on their use.
    Dependence is the tendency of the body to manifest a characteristic
and unpleasant withdrawal syndrome if regular dose of drugs/alcohol
is abruptly discontinued. This is characterised by anxiety, shakiness,
nausea and sweating, which may be relieved when use is resumed again.
In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be severe and even life
threatening and the person may need medical supervision.
    Dependence leads the patient to ignore all social norms in order to
get sufficient funds to satiate his/her needs. These result in many social
adjustment problems.

7.5.3 Effects of Drug/Alcohol Abuse
The immediate adverse effects of drugs and alcohol abuse are manifested
in the form of reckless behaviour, vandalism and violence. Excessive
doses of drugs may lead to coma and death due to respiratory failure,
heart failure or cerebral hemorrhage. A combination of drugs or their
intake along with alcohol generally results in overdosing and even
deaths. The most common warning signs of drug and alcohol abuse
among youth include drop in academic performance, unexplained
absence from school/college, lack of interest in personal hygiene,
withdrawal, isolation, depression, fatigue, aggressive and rebellious
behaviour, deteriorating relationships with family and friends, loss of
interest in hobbies, change in sleeping and eating habits, fluctuations
in weight, appetite, etc.                                                       145
    There may even be some far-reaching implications of drug/alcohol
abuse. If an abuser is unable to get money to buy drugs/alcohol he/she
may turn to stealing. The adverse effects are just not restricted to the
person who is using drugs or alcohol. At times, a drug/alcohol addict
becomes the cause of mental and financial distress to his/her entire family
and friends.

                     Those who take drugs intravenously (direct injection into the vein
                using a needle and syringe), are much more likely to acquire serious
                infections like AIDS and Hepatitis B. The viruses, which are responsible
                for these diseases, are transferred from one person to another by sharing
                of infected needles and syringes. Both AIDS and Hepatitis B infections
                are chronic infections and ultimately fatal. Both can be transmitted
                through sexual contact or infected blood.
                     The use of alcohol during adolescence may also have long-term effects.
                It could lead to heavy drinking in adulthood. The chronic use of drugs and
                alcohol damages nervous system and liver (cirrhosis). The use of drugs
                and alcohol during pregnancy is also known to adversely affect the foetus.
                     Another misuse of drugs is what certain sportspersons do to enhance
                their performance. They (mis)use narcotic analgesics, anabolic steroids,
                diuretics and certain hormones in sports to increase muscle strength and
                bulk and to promote aggressiveness and as a result increase athletic
                performance. The side-effects of the use of anabolic steroids in females
                include masculinisation (features like males), increased aggressiveness,
                mood swings, depression, abnormal menstrual cycles, excessive hair
                growth on the face and body, enlargement of clitoris, deepening of voice.
                In males it includes acne, increased aggressiveness, mood swings,
                depression, reduction of size of the testicles, decreased sperm production,
                potential for kidney and liver dysfunction, breast enlargement, premature
                baldness, enlargement of the prostate gland. These effects may be
                permanent with prolonged use. In the adolescent male or female, severe
                facial and body acne, and premature closure of the growth centres of the
                long bones may result in stunted growth.

                7.5.4 Prevention and Control
                The age-old adage of ‘prevention is better than cure’ holds true here also.
                It is also true that habits such as smoking, taking drug or alcohol are
                more likely to be taken up at a young age, more during adolescence.
                Hence, it is best to identify the situations that may push an adolescent
                towards use of drugs or alcohol, and to take remedial measures well in
                time. In this regard, the parents and the teachers have a special
                responsibility. Parenting that combines with high levels of nurturance
                and consistent discipline, has been associated with lowered risk of
                substance (alcohol/drugs/tobacco) abuse. Some of the measures
                mentioned here would be particularly useful for prevention and control
146             of alcohol and drugs abuse among adolescents
                  (i) Avoid undue peer pressure - Every child has his/her own choice
                      and personality, which should be respected and nurtured. A child
                      should not be pushed unduly to perform beyond his/her threshold
                      limits; be it studies, sports or other activities.

HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE


 (ii) Education and counselling - Educating and counselling him/
      her to face problems and stresses, and to accept disappointments
      and failures as a part of life. It would also be worthwhile to channelise
      the child’s energy into healthy pursuits like sports, reading, music,
      yoga and other extracurricular activities.
(iii) Seeking help from parents and peers - Help from parents and
      peers should be sought immediately so that they can guide
      appropriately. Help may even be sought from close and trusted
      friends. Besides getting proper advise to sort out their problems,
      this would help young to vent their feelings of anxiety and guilt.
(iv) Looking for danger signs - Alert parents and teachers need to
      look for and identify the danger signs discussed above. Even friends,
      if they find someone using drugs or alcohol, should not hesitate to
      bring this to the notice of parents or teacher in the best interests of
      the person concerned. Appropriate measures would then be required
      to diagnose the malady and the underlying causes. This would help
      in initiating proper remedial steps or treatment.
 (v) Seeking professional and medical help - A lot of help is available
      in the form of highly qualified psychologists, psychiatrists, and de-
      addiction and rehabilitation programmes to help individuals who
      have unfortunately got in the quagmire of drug/alcohol abuse. With
      such help, the affected individual with sufficient efforts and will power,
      can get rid of the problem completely and lead a perfectly normal
      and healthy life.


                                 SUMMARY

   Health is not just the absence of disease. It is a state of complete physical,
   mental, social and psychological well-being. Diseases like typhoid,
   cholera, pneumonia, fungal infections of skin, malaria and many others
   are a major cause of distress to human beings. Vector-borne diseases
   like malaria especially one caused by Plasmodium falciparum, if not
   treated, may prove fatal. Besides personal cleanliness and hygiene,
   public health measures like proper disposal of waste, decontamination
   of drinking water, control of vectors like mosquitoes and immunisation
   are very helpful in preventing these diseases. Our immune system plays
   the major role in preventing these diseases when we are exposed to
   disease-causing agents. The innate defences of our body like skin,
   mucous membranes, antimicrobial substances present in our tears,
   saliva and the phagocytic cells help to block the entry of pathogens
                                                                                    147
   into our body. If the pathogens succeed in gaining entry to our body,
   specific antibodies (humoral immune response) and cells (cell mediated
   immune response) serve to kill these pathogens. Immune system has
   memory. On subsequent exposure to same pathogen, the immune
   response is rapid and more intense. This forms the basis of protection

                 afforded by vaccination and immunisation. Among other diseases, AIDS
                 and cancer kill a large number of individuals worldwide. AIDS caused
                 by the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) is fatal but can be
                 prevented if certain precautions are taken. Many cancers are curable if
                 detected early and appropriate therapeutic measures are taken. Of late,
                 drug and alcohol abuse among youth and adolescents is becoming
                 another cause of concern. Because of the addictive nature of alcohol
                 and drugs, and their perceived benefits like relief from stress, a person
                 may try taking these in the face of peer pressure, examinations-related
                 and competition-related stresses. In doing so, he/she may get addicted
                 to them. Education about their harmful effects, counselling and seeking
                 immediate professional and medical help would totally relieve the
                 individual from these evils.

                                   under the layers of snow several metres thick, and in highly
                                   acidic environments. Microbes are diverse– protozoa,
                                   bacteria, fungi and microscopic animal and plant viruses,
                                   viroids and also prions that are proteinacious infectious
                                   agents. Some of the microbes are shown in Figures 8.1
                                   and 8.2.
                                       Microbes like bacteria and many fungi can be grown
                                   on nutritive media to form colonies (Figure 8.3), that can
                                   be seen with the naked eyes. Such cultures are useful in
                                   studies on micro-organisms.

MICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE


    In chapter 7, you have read that microbes cause a large number of
diseases in human beings. They also cause diseases in animals and plants.
But this should not make you think that all microbes are harmful; several
microbes are useful to man in diverse ways. Some of the most important
contributions of microbes to human welfare are discussed in this chapter.

8.1 MICROBES IN HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS
You would be surprised to know that we use microbes or products
derived from them everyday. A common example is the production of
curd from milk. Micro-organisms such as Lactobacillus and others
commonly called lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk and convert it
to curd. During growth, the LAB produce acids that coagulate and
partially digest the milk proteins. A small amount of curd added to the
fresh milk as inoculum or starter contain millions of LAB, which at
suitable temperatures multiply, thus converting milk to curd, which
also improves its nutritional quality by increasing vitamin B12 . In our
stomach too, the LAB play very beneficial role in checking disease-
causing microbes.
    The dough, which is used for making foods such as dosa and idli is
also fermented by bacteria. The puffed-up appearance of dough is due to
the production of CO2 gas. Can you tell which metabolic pathway is
taking place resulting in the formation of CO2? Where do you think the
bacteria for these fermentations come from? Similarly the dough, which
is used for making bread, is fermented using baker’s yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae). A number of traditional drinks and foods
are also made by fermentation by the microbes. ‘Toddy’, a traditional
drink of some parts of southern India is made by fermenting sap from
palms. Microbes are also used to ferment fish, soyabean and bamboo-
shoots to make foods. Cheese, is one of the oldest food items in which
microbes were used. Different varieties of cheese are known by their
characteristic texture, flavour and taste, the specificity coming from the
microbes used. For example, the large holes in ‘Swiss cheese’ are due to
production of a large amount of CO 2 by a bacterium named
Propionibacterium sharmanii. The ‘Roquefort cheese’ are ripened by
growing a specific fungi on them, which gives them a particular flavour.

8.2     MICROBES IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS                                      151
Even in industry, microbes are used to synthesise a number of products
valuable to human beings. Beverages and antibiotics are some examples.
Production on an industrial scale, requires growing microbes in very large
vessels called fermentors (Figure 8.4).

                                                  8.2.1 Fermented Beverages
                                                  Microbes especially yeasts have been used from
                                                  time immemorial for the production of beverages
                                                  like wine, beer, whisky, brandy or rum. For this
                                                  purpose the same yeast Saccharomyces
                                                  cerevisiae used for bread-making and
                                                  commonly called brewer’s yeast, is used for
                                                  fermenting malted cereals and fruit juices, to
                                                  produce ethanol. Do you recollect the metabolic
                                                  reactions, which result in the production of
                                                  ethanol by yeast? Depending on the type of the
                                                  raw material used for fermentation and the type
           Figure 8.4 Fermentors
                                                  of processing (with or without distillation)
                                                  different types of alcoholic drinks are obtained.
                                                  Wine and beer are produced without distillation
                                                  whereas whisky, brandy and rum are produced
                                                  by distillation of the fermented broth. The
                                                  photograph of a fermentation plant is shown in
                                                  Figure 8.5.

                                                  8.2.2 Antibiotics
                                               Antibiotics produced by microbes are regarded
                                               as one of the most significant discoveries of the
                                               twentieth century and have greatly contributed
                                               towards the welfare of the human society. Anti is
                                               a Greek word that means ‘against’, and bio means
      Figure 8.5 Fermentation Plant
                                               ‘life’, together they mean ‘against life’ (in the
                      context of disease causing organisms); whereas with reference to human
                      beings, they are ‘pro life’ and not against. Antibiotics are chemical
                      substances, which are produced by some microbes and can kill or retard
                      the growth of other (disease-causing) microbes.
                          You are familiar with the commonly used antibiotic Penicillin. Do you
                      know that Penicillin was the first antibiotic to be discovered, and it was a
                      chance discovery? Alexander Fleming while working on Staphylococci
                      bacteria, once observed a mould growing in one of his unwashed culture
                      plates around which Staphylococci could not grow. He found out that it
                      was due to a chemical produced by the mould and he named it Penicillin
152                   after the mould Penicillium notatum. However, its full potential as an
                      effective antibiotic was established much later by Ernest Chain and
                      Howard Florey. This antibiotic was extensively used to treat American
                      soldiers wounded in World War II. Fleming, Chain and Florey were awarded
                      the Nobel Prize in 1945, for this discovery.

MICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE


    After Penicillin, other antibiotics were also purified from other
microbes. Can you name some other antibiotics and find out their
sources? Antibiotics have greatly improved our capacity to treat deadly
diseases such as plague, whooping cough (kali khansi ), diphtheria (gal
ghotu) and leprosy (kusht rog), which used to kill millions all over the
globe. Today, we cannot imagine a world without antibiotics.


8.2.3 Chemicals, Enzymes and other Bioactive Molecules
Microbes are also used for commercial and industrial production of
certain chemicals like organic acids, alcohols and enzymes. Examples of
acid producers are Aspergillus niger (a fungus) of citric acid, Acetobacter
aceti (a bacterium) of acetic acid; Clostridium butylicum (a bacterium) of
butyric acid and Lactobacillus (a bacterium) of lactic acid.
    Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is used for commercial production
of ethanol. Microbes are also used for production of enzymes. Lipases are
used in detergent formulations and are helpful in removing oily stains
from the laundry. You must have noticed that bottled fruit juices bought
from the market are clearer as compared to those made at home. This is
because the bottled juices are clarified by the use of pectinases and
proteases. Streptokinase produced by the bacterium Streptococcus and
modified by genetic engineering is used as a ‘clot buster’ for removing
clots from the blood vessels of patients who have undergone myocardial
infarction leading to heart attack.
    Another bioactive molecule, cyclosporin A, that is used as an
immunosuppressive agent in organ-transplant patients, is produced by
the fungus Trichoderma polysporum. Statins produced by the yeast
Monascus purpureus have been commercialised as blood-cholesterol
lowering agents. It acts by competitively inhibiting the enzyme responsible
for synthesis of cholesterol.


8.3 MICROBES IN SEWAGE TREATMENT
We know that large quantities of waste water are generated everyday in
cities and towns. A major component of this waste water is human excreta.
This municipal waste-water is also called sewage. It contains large
amounts of organic matter and microbes. Many of which are pathogenic.         153
Have you ever wondered where this huge quantity of sewage or urban
waste water is disposed off daily? This cannot be discharged into natural
water bodies like rivers and streams directly – you can understand why.
Before disposal, hence, sewage is treated in sewage treatment plants (STPs)
to make it less polluting. Treatment of waste water is done by the

                                                     heterotrophic microbes naturally present in
                                                     the sewage. This treatment is carried out in
                                                     two stages:
                                                    Primary treatment : These treatment
                                                steps basically involve physical removal of
                                                particles – large and small – from the sewage
                                                through filtration and sedimentation. These
                                                are removed in stages; initially, floating debris
                                                is removed by sequential filtration. Then the
                                                grit (soil and small pebbles) are removed by
                                                sedimentation. All solids that settle form the
                                                primary sludge, and the supernatant forms
      Figure 8.6 Secondary treatment
                                                the effluent. The effluent from the primary
                                                settling tank is taken for secondary treatment.
                       Secondary treatment or Biological treatment : The primary
                   effluent is passed into large aeration tanks (Figure 8.6) where it is
                   constantly agitated mechanically and air is pumped into it. This allows
                   vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into flocs (masses of
                   bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh like
                   structures). While growing, these microbes consume the major part
                   of the organic matter in the effluent. This significantly reduces the
                   BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) of the effluent. BOD refers to
                   the amount of the oxygen that would be consumed if all the organic
                   matter in one liter of water were oxidised by bacteria. The sewage
                   water is treated till the BOD is reduced. The BOD test measures the
                   rate of uptake of oxygen by micro-organisms in a sample of water
                   and thus, indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present
                   in the water. The greater the BOD of waste water, more is its polluting
                   potential.
                       Once the BOD of sewage or waste water is reduced significantly, the
                   effluent is then passed into a settling tank where the bacterial ‘flocs’ are
                   allowed to sediment. This sediment is called activated sludge. A small
                   part of the activated sludge is pumped back into the aeration tank to
                   serve as the inoculum. The remaining major part of the sludge is pumped
                   into large tanks called anaerobic sludge digesters. Here, other kinds
                   of bacteria, which grow anaerobically, digest the bacteria and the fungi
154                in the sludge. During this digestion, bacteria produce a mixture of gases
                   such as methane, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide. These gases
                   form biogas and can be used as source of energy as it is inflammable.
                       The effluent from the secondary treatment plant is generally released
                   into natural water bodies like rivers and streams. An aerial view of such
                   a plant is shown in Figure 8.7.

MICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE


    You can appreciate how microbes play a major
role in treating millions of gallons of waste water
everyday across the globe. This methodology has
been practiced for more than a century now, in
almost all parts of the world. Till date, no man-
made technology has been able to rival the
microbial treatment of sewage.
    You are aware that due to increasing
urbanisation, sewage is being produced in much
larger quantities than ever before. However the
number of sewage treatment plants has not             Figure 8.7 An aerial view of a sewage plant
increased enough to treat such large quantities.
So the untreated sewage is often discharged directly into rivers leading to
their pollution and increase in water-borne diseases.
    The Ministry of Environment and Forests has initiated Ganga Action
Plan and Yamuna Action Plan to save these major rivers of our country
from pollution. Under these plans, it is proposed to build a large number
of sewage treatment plants so that only treated sewage may be discharged
in the rivers. A visit to a sewage treatment plant situated in any place
near you would be a very interesting and educating experience.

8.4 MICROBES IN PRODUCTION OF BIOGAS
Biogas is a mixture of gases (containing predominantly methane) produced
by the microbial activity and which may be used as fuel. You have learnt
that microbes produce different types of gaseous end-products during
growth and metabolism. The type of the gas produced depends upon the
microbes and the organic substrates they utilise. In the examples cited in
relation to fermentation of dough, cheese making and production of
beverages, the main gas produced was CO2.. However, certain bacteria,
which grow anaerobically on cellulosic material, produce large amount
of methane along with CO2 and H2. These bacteria are collectively called
methanogens, and one such common bacterium is Methanobacterium.
These bacteria are commonly found in the anaerobic sludge during
sewage treatment. These bacteria are also present in the rumen (a part of
stomach) of cattle. A lot of cellulosic material present in the food of cattle
is also present in the rumen. In rumen, these bacteria help in the
breakdown of cellulose and play an important role in the nutrition of
cattle. Do you think we, human beings, are able to digest the celluose                      155
present in our foods? Thus, the excreta (dung) of cattle, commonly called
gobar, is rich in these bacteria. Dung can be used for generation of biogas,
commonly called gobar gas.
    The biogas plant consists of a concrete tank (10-15 feet deep) in which
bio-wastes are collected and a slurry of dung is fed. A floating cover is

                                                               keeps on rising as the gas is
                                                               produced in the tank due to the

                                                               plant has an outlet, which is
                                                               connected to a pipe to supply

                                                               as fertiliser. Cattle dung is
                                                               available in large quantities in

                                                               for a variety of purposes. So

                 in a village or near a village, it would be very interesting to enquire if there
                 are any biogas plants nearby. Visit the biogas plant and learn more about
                 it from the people who are actually managing it.

                  8.5 MICROBES AS BIOCONTROL AGENTS
                  Biocontrol refers to the use of biological methods for controlling plant
                  diseases and pests. In modern society, these problems have been tackled
                  increasingly by the use of chemicals – by use of insecticides and pesticides.
                  These chemicals are toxic and extremely harmful, to human beings and
                  animals alike, and have been polluting our environment (soil, ground
                  water), fruits, vegetables and crop plants. Our soil is also polluted through
                  our use of weedicides to remove weeds.
                       Biological control of pests and diseases: In agriculture, there is a
                  method of controlling pests that relies on natural predation rather than
156               introduced chemicals. A key belief of the organic farmer is that biodiversity
                  furthers health. The more variety a landscape has, the more sustainable
                  it is. The organic farmer, therefore, works to create a system where the
                  insects that are sometimes called pests are not eradicated, but instead
                  are kept at manageable levels by a complex system of checks and balances
                  within a living and vibrant ecosystem. Contrary to the ‘conventional’
                  farming practices which often use chemical methods to kill both useful

MICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE


and harmful life forms indiscriminately, this is a holistic approach that
seeks to develop an understanding of the webs of interaction between the
myriad of organisms that constitute the field fauna and flora. The organic
farmer holds the view that the eradication of the creatures that are often
described as pests is not only possible, but also undesirable, for without
them the beneficial predatory and parasitic insects which depend upon
them as food or hosts would not be able to survive. Thus, the use of
biocontrol measures will greatly reduce our dependence on toxic chemicals
and pesticides. An important part of the biological farming approach is
to become familiar with the various life forms that inhabit the field,
predators as well as pests, and also their life cycles, patterns of feeding
and the habitats that they prefer. This will help develop appropriate means
of biocontrol.
     The very familiar beetle with red and black markings – the Ladybird,
and Dragonflies are useful to get rid of aphids and mosquitoes,
respectively. An example of microbial biocontrol agents that can be
introduced in order to control butterfly caterpillars is the bacteria Bacillus
thuringiensis (often written as Bt ). These are available in sachets as dried
spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants
such as brassicas and fruit trees, where these are eaten by the insect
larvae. In the gut of the larvae, the toxin is released and the larvae get
killed. The bacterial disease will kill the caterpillars, but leave other insects
unharmed. Because of the development of methods of genetic engineering
in the last decade or so, the scientists have introduced B. thuringiensis
toxin genes into plants. Such plants are resistant to attack by insect pests.
Bt-cotton is one such example, which is being cultivated in some states
of our country. You will learn more about this in chapter 10.
     A biological control being developed for use in the treatment of plant
disease is the fungus Trichoderma. Trichoderma species are free-living
fungi that are very common in the root ecosystems. They are effective
biocontrol agents of several plant pathogens.
     Baculoviruses are pathogens that attack insects and other arthropods.
The majority of baculoviruses used as biological control agents are in the
genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus. These viruses are excellent candidates for
species-specific, narrow spectrum insecticidal applications. They have
been shown to have no negative impacts on plants, mammals, birds, fish
or even on non-target insects. This is especially desirable when beneficial
insects are being conserved to aid in an overall integrated pest
management (IPM) programme, or when an ecologically sensitive area is               157
being treated.

of concern. The use of the chemical fertilisers to meet the ever-increasing

                demand of agricultural produce has contributed significantly to
                this pollution. Of course, we have now realised that there are problems
                associated with the overuse of chemical fertilisers and there is a
                large pressure to switch to organic farming – the use of biofertilisers.
                Biofertilisers are organisms that enrich the nutrient quality of the soil.
                The main sources of biofertilisers are bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria.
                You have studied about the nodules on the roots of leguminous plants
                formed by the symbiotic association of Rhizobium. These bacteria fix
                atmospheric nitrogen into organic forms, which is used by the plant as
                nutrient. Other bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen while free-living in
                the soil (examples Azospirillum and Azotobacter), thus enriching the
                nitrogen content of the soil.
                    Fungi are also known to form symbiotic associations with plants
                (mycorrhiza). Many members of the genus Glomus form mycorrhiza.
                The fungal symbiont in these associations absorbs phosphorus from
                soil and passes it to the plant. Plants having such associations show
                other benefits also, such as resistance to root-borne pathogens, tolerance
                to salinity and drought, and an overall increase in plant growth and
                development. Can you tell what advantage the fungus derives from
                this association?
                    Cyanobacteria are autotrophic microbes widely distributed in aquatic
                and terrestrial environments many of which can fix atmospheric nitrogen,
                e.g. Anabaena, Nostoc, Oscillatoria, etc. In paddy fields, cyanobacteria
                serve as an important biofertiliser. Blue green algae also add organic matter
                to the soil and increase its fertility. Currently, in our country, a number
                of biofertilisers are available commercially in the market and farmers use
                these regularly in their fields to replenish soil nutrients and to reduce
                dependence on chemical fertilisers.


                                                  SUMMARY

                  Microbes are a very important component of life on earth. Not all
                  microbes are pathogenic. Many microbes are very useful to human
                  beings. We use microbes and microbially derived products almost every
                  day. Bacteria called lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk to convert it
                  into curd. The dough, which is used to make bread, is fermented by
                  yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Certain dishes such as idli and
                  dosa, are made from dough fermented by microbes. Bacteria and fungi
158               are used to impart particular texture, taste and flavor to cheese. Microbes
                  are used to produce industrial products like lactic acid, acetic acid
                  and alcohol, which are used in a variety of processes in the industry.
                  Antibiotics like penicillins produced by useful microbes are used to kill
                  disease-causing harmful microbes. Antibiotics have played a major role
                  in controlling infectious diseases like diphtheria, whooping cough and

  pneumonia. For more than a hundred years, microbes are being used
  to treat sewage (waste water) by the process of activated sludge formation
  and this helps in recycling of water in nature. Methanogens produce
  methane (biogas) while degrading plant waste. Biogas produced by
  microbes is used as a source of energy in rural areas. Microbes can also
  be used to kill harmful pests, a process called as biocontrol. The
  biocontrol measures help us to avoid heavy use of toxic pesticides for
  controlling pests. There is a need these days to push for use of
  biofertilisers in place of chemical fertilisers. It is clear from the diverse
  uses human beings have put microbes to that they play an important
  role in the welfare of human society.

                Herbert Boyer was born in 1936 and brought up in a corner of western
                Pennsylvania where railroads and mines were the destiny of most young
                men. He completed graduate work at the University of Pittsburgh, in
                1963, followed by three years of post-graduate studies at Yale.
                    In 1966, Boyer took over assistant professorship at the University of
                California at San Francisco. By 1969, he performed studies on a couple
                of restriction enzymes of the E. coli bacterium with especially useful
                properties. Boyer observed that these enzymes have the capability of
                cutting DNA strands in a particular fashion, which left what has became
                known as ‘sticky ends’ on the strands. These clipped ends made pasting
                together pieces of DNA a precise exercise.
                    This discovery, in turn, led to a rich and rewarding conversation in
                Hawaii with a Stanford scientist named Stanley Cohen. Cohen had
                been studying small ringlets of DNA called plasmids and which float
                about freely in the cytoplasm of certain bacterial cells and replicate
HERBERT BOYER   independently from the coding strand of DNA. Cohen had developed
  (1936 )       a method of removing these plasmids from the cell and then reinserting
                them in other cells. Combining this process with that of DNA splicing
                enabled Boyer and Cohen to recombine segments of DNA in desired
                configurations and insert the DNA in bacterial cells, which could then
                act as manufacturing plants for specific proteins. This breakthrough was
                the basis upon which the discipline of biotechnology was founded.

      DNA Technology
                                    biotechnology. However, it is used in a restricted sense
                                    today, to refer to such of those processes which use
                                    genetically modified organisms to achieve the same on a
                                    larger scale. Further, many other processes/techniques are
                                    also included under biotechnology. For example, in vitro
                                    fertilisation leading to a ‘test-tube’ baby, synthesising a
                                    gene and using it, developing a DNA vaccine or correcting
                                    a defective gene, are all part of biotechnology.
                                        The European Federation of Biotechnology (EFB) has
                                    given a definition of biotechnology that encompasses both
                                    traditional view and modern molecular biotechnology.
                                    The definition given by EFB is as follows:
                                        ‘The integration of natural science and organisms,
                                    cells, parts thereof, and molecular analogues for products

                          to introduce these into host organisms and thus change the
                          phenotype of the host organism.

                          to enable growth of only the desired microbe/eukaryotic cell in
                          large quantities for the manufacture of biotechnological products
                          like antibiotics, vaccines, enzymes, etc.
                    Let us now understand the conceptual development of the principles
                of genetic engineering.
                    You probably appreciate the advantages of sexual reproduction over
                asexual reproduction. The former provides opportunities for variations
                and formulation of unique combinations of genetic setup, some of which
                may be beneficial to the organism as well as the population. Asexual
                reproduction preserves the genetic information, while sexual reproduction
                permits variation. Traditional hybridisation procedures used in plant and
                animal breeding, very often lead to inclusion and multiplication of
                undesirable genes along with the desired genes. The techniques of genetic
                engineering which include creation of recombinant DNA, use of
                gene cloning and gene transfer, overcome this limitation and allows us
                to isolate and introduce only one or a set of desirable genes without
                introducing undesirable genes into the target organism.
                    Do you know the likely fate of a piece of DNA, which is somehow
                transferred into an alien organism? Most likely, this piece of DNA would
                not be able to multiply itself in the progeny cells of the organism. But,
                when it gets integrated into the genome of the recipient, it may multiply
                and be inherited along with the host DNA. This is because the alien piece
                of DNA has become part of a chromosome, which has the ability to
                replicate. In a chromosome there is a specific DNA sequence called the
                origin of replication, which is responsible for initiating replication.
                Therefore, for the multiplication of any alien piece of DNA in an organism
                it needs to be a part of a chromosome(s) which has a specific sequence
                known as ‘origin of replication’. Thus, an alien DNA is linked with the
                origin of replication, so that, this alien piece of DNA can replicate and
                multiply itself in the host organism. This can also be called as cloning or
                making multiple identical copies of any template DNA.
                    Let us now focus on the first instance of the construction of an artificial
                recombinant DNA molecule. The construction of the first recombinant
                DNA emerged from the possibility of linking a gene encoding antibiotic
164             resistance with a native plasmid (autonomously replicating circular
                extra-chromosomal DNA) of Salmonella typhimurium. Stanley Cohen and
                Herbert Boyer accomplished this in 1972 by isolating the antibiotic
                resistance gene by cutting out a piece of DNA from a plasmid which was
                responsible for conferring antibiotic resistance. The cutting of DNA at
                specific locations became possible with the discovery of the so-called

BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES


‘molecular scissors’– restriction enzymes. The cut piece of DNA was
then linked with the plasmid DNA. These plasmid DNA act as vectors to
transfer the piece of DNA attached to it. You probably know that mosquito
acts as an insect vector to transfer the malarial parasite into human body.
In the same way, a plasmid can be used as vector to deliver an alien piece
of DNA into the host organism. The linking of antibiotic resistance gene
with the plasmid vector became possible with the enzyme DNA ligase,
which acts on cut DNA molecules and joins their ends. This makes a new
combination of circular autonomously replicating DNA created in vitro
and is known as recombinant DNA. When this DNA is transferred into
Escherichia coli, a bacterium closely related to Salmonella, it could
replicate using the new host’s DNA polymerase enzyme and make multiple
copies. The ability to multiply copies of antibiotic resistance gene in
E. coli was called cloning of antibiotic resistance gene in E. coli.
     You can hence infer that there are three basic steps in genetically
modifying an organism —
   (i) identification of DNA with desirable genes;
 (ii) introduction of the identified DNA into the host;
 (iii) maintenance of introduced DNA in the host and transfer of the DNA
       to its progeny.

9.2     TOOLS OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY
Now we know from the foregoing discussion that genetic engineering or
recombinant DNA technology can be accomplished only if we have the
key tools, i.e., restriction enzymes, polymerase enzymes, ligases, vectors
and the host organism. Let us try to understand some of these in detail.

9.2.1 Restriction Enzymes
In the year 1963, the two enzymes responsible for restricting the growth
of bacteriophage in Escherichia coli were isolated. One of these added
methyl groups to DNA, while the other cut DNA. The later was called
restriction endonuclease.
    The first restriction endonuclease–Hind II, whose functioning
depended on a specific DNA nucleotide sequence was isolated and
characterised five years later. It was found that Hind II always cut DNA
molecules at a particular point by recognising a specific sequence of
six base pairs. This specific base sequence is known as the
recognition sequence for Hind II. Besides Hind II, today we know more
than 900 restriction enzymes that have been isolated from over 230 strains     165
of bacteria each of which recognise different recognition sequences.
    The convention for naming these enzymes is the first letter of the name
comes from the genus and the second two letters come from the species of
the prokaryotic cell from which they were isolated, e.g., EcoRI comes from
Escherichia coli RY 13. In EcoRI, the letter ‘R’ is derived from the name of

                     strain. Roman numbers following the names indicate the order in which
                     the enzymes were isolated from that strain of bacteria.
                         Restriction enzymes belong to a larger class of enzymes called
                     nucleases. These are of two kinds; exonucleases and endonucleases.
                     Exonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of the DNA whereas,
                     endonucleases make cuts at specific positions within the DNA.
                         Each restriction endonuclease functions by ‘inspecting’ the length of
                     a DNA sequence. Once it finds its specific recognition sequence, it
                     will bind to the DNA and cut each of the two strands of the double
                     helix at specific points in their sugar -phosphate backbones
                     (Figure 9.1). Each restriction endonuclease recognises a specific
                     palindromic nucleotide sequences in the DNA.

                         Do you know what palindromes are? These are groups of letters
                     that form the same words when read both forward and backward,
                     e.g., “MALAYALAM”. As against a word-palindrome where the same
                     word is read in both directions, the palindrome in DNA is a sequence
                     of base pairs that reads same on the two strands when orientation of

reading is kept the same. For example, the following sequences reads
the same on the two strands in 5' à 3' direction. This is also true if
read in the 3' à 5' direction.

    Restriction enzymes cut the strand of DNA a little away from the centre
of the palindrome sites, but between the same two bases on the opposite
strands. This leaves single stranded portions at the ends. There are
overhanging stretches called sticky ends on each strand (Figure 9.1). These
are named so because they form hydrogen bonds with their
complementary cut counterparts. This stickiness of the ends facilitates
the action of the enzyme DNA ligase.
    Restriction endonucleases are used in genetic engineering to form
‘recombinant’ molecules of DNA, which are composed of DNA from
different sources/genomes.
    When cut by the same restriction enzyme, the resultant DNA fragments
have the same kind of ‘sticky-ends’ and, these can be joined together
(end-to-end) using DNA ligases (Figure 9.2).

                         You may have realised that normally, unless one cuts the vector and
                     the source DNA with the same restriction enzyme, the recombinant vector
                     molecule cannot be created.
                     Separation and isolation of DNA fragments : The cutting of DNA by
                     restriction endonucleases results in the fragments of DNA. These fragments
                     can be separated by a technique known as gel electrophoresis. Since
                     DNA fragments are negatively charged molecules they can be separated
                     by forcing them to move towards the anode under an electric field through
                     a medium/matrix. Nowadays the most commonly used matrix is agarose
                     which is a natural polymer extracted from sea weeds. The DNA fragments
                     separate (resolve) according to their size through sieving effect provided
                     by the agarose gel. Hence, the smaller the fragment size, the farther it
                     moves. Look at the Figure 9.3 and guess at which end of the gel the
                     sample was loaded.
                                                           The separated DNA fragments can be

                    9.2.2 Cloning Vectors
                    You know that plasmids and bacteriophages have the ability to replicate
                    within bacterial cells independent of the control of chromosomal DNA.
                    Bacteriophages because of their high number per cell, have very high
                    copy numbers of their genome within the bacterial cells. Some plasmids
                    may have only one or two copies per cell whereas others may have
168                 15-100 copies per cell. Their numbers can go even higher. If we are able
                    to link an alien piece of DNA with bacteriophage or plasmid DNA, we can
                    multiply its numbers equal to the copy number of the plasmid or
                    bacteriophage. Vectors used at present, are engineered in such a way
                    that they help easy linking of foreign DNA and selection of recombinants
                    from non-recombinants.

BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES


     The following are the features that are required to facilitate cloning
into a vector.
   (i) Origin of replication (ori) : This is a sequence from where
       replication starts and any piece of DNA when linked to this sequence
       can be made to replicate within the host cells. This sequence is also
       responsible for controlling the copy number of the linked DNA. So,
       if one wants to recover many copies of the target DNA it should be
       cloned in a vector whose origin support high copy number.
  (ii) Selectable marker : In addition to ‘ori’, the vector requires a
       selectable marker, which helps in identifying and eliminating non-
       transformants and selectively permitting the growth of the
       transformants. Transformation is a procedure through which a
       piece of DNA is introduced in a host bacterium (you will study the
       process in subsequent section). Normally, the genes encoding
       resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
       tetracycline or kanamycin, etc., are considered useful selectable
       markers for E. coli. The normal E. coli cells do not carry resistance
       against any of these antibiotics.
 (iii) Cloning sites: In order to link the
       alien DNA, the vector needs to have
       very few, preferably single,
       recognition sites for the commonly
       used restriction enzymes. Presence of
       more than one recognition sites within
       the vector will generate several
       fragments, which will complicate the
       gene cloning (Figure 9.4). The ligation
       of alien DNA is carried out at a
       restriction site present in one of the two
       antibiotic resistance genes. For
       example, you can ligate a foreign DNA
                                                      Figure 9.4 E. coli cloning vector pBR322

                                                                    (ampR and tetR). rop codes for

       ampicillin containing medium are then transferred on a medium
       containing tetracycline. The recombinants will grow in ampicillin
       containing medium but not on that containing tetracycline. But,
       non- recombinants will grow on the medium containing both the
       antibiotics. In this case, one antibiotic resistance gene helps in
       selecting the transformants, whereas the other antibiotic resistance

                      gene gets ‘inactivated due to insertion’ of alien DNA, and helps in
                      selection of recombinants.
                         Selection of recombinants due to inactivation of antibiotics is a
                      cumbersome procedure because it requires simultaneous plating
                      on two plates having different antibiotics. Therefore, alternative
                      selectable markers have been developed which differentiate
                      recombinants from non-recombinants on the basis of their ability
                      to produce colour in the presence of a chromogenic substrate. In
                      this, a recombinant DNA is inserted within the coding sequence of
                      an enzyme, β-galactosidase. This results into inactivation of the
                      gene for synthesis of this enzyme, which is referred to as insertional
                      inactivation. The presence of a chromogenic substrate gives blue
                      coloured colonies if the plasmid in the bacteria does not have an
                      insert. Presence of insert results into insertional inactivation of the
                      β-galactosidase gene and the colonies do not produce any colour,
                      these are identified as recombinant colonies.
                 (iv) Vectors for cloning genes in plants and animals : You may be
                      surprised to know that we have learnt the lesson of transferring genes
                      into plants and animals from bacteria and viruses which have known
                      this for ages – how to deliver genes to transform eukaryotic cells and
                      force them to do what the bacteria or viruses want. For example,
                      Agrobacterium tumifaciens, a pathogen of several dicot plants is able
                      to deliver a piece of DNA known as ‘ T-DNA’ to transform normal
                      plant cells into a tumor and direct these tumor cells to produce the
                      chemicals required by the pathogen. Similarly, retroviruses in animals
                      have the ability to transform normal cells into cancerous cells. A
                      better understanding of the art of delivering genes by pathogens in
                      their eukaryotic hosts has generated knowledge to transform these
                      tools of pathogens into useful vectors for delivering genes of interest
                      to humans. The tumor inducing (Ti) plasmid of Agrobacterium
                      tumifaciens has now been modified into a cloning vector which is no
                      more pathogenic to the plants but is still able to use the mechanisms
                      to deliver genes of our interest into a variety of plants. Similarly,
                      retroviruses have also been disarmed and are now used to deliver
                      desirable genes into animal cells. So, once a gene or a DNA fragment
                      has been ligated into a suitable vector it is transferred into a bacterial,
                      plant or animal host (where it multiplies).

170                        Recombinant DNA)
                Since DNA is a hydrophilic molecule, it cannot pass through cell
                membranes. Why? In order to force bacteria to take up the plasmid, the
                bacterial cells must first be made ‘competent’ to take up DNA. This is
                done by treating them with a specific concentration of a divalent cation,
                such as calcium, which increases the efficiency with which DNA enters

the bacterium through pores in its cell wall. Recombinant DNA can then
be forced into such cells by incubating the cells with recombinant DNA
on ice, followed by placing them briefly at 420C (heat shock), and then
putting them back on ice. This enables the bacteria to take up the
recombinant DNA.
    This is not the only way to introduce alien DNA into host cells. In a
method known as micro-injection, recombinant DNA is directly injected
into the nucleus of an animal cell. In another method, suitable for plants,
cells are bombarded with high velocity micro-particles of gold or tungsten
coated with DNA in a method known as biolistics or gene gun. And the
last method uses ‘disarmed pathogen’ vectors, which when allowed to
infect the cell, transfer the recombinant DNA into the host.
    Now that we have learnt about the tools for constructing recombinant
DNA, let us discuss the processes facilitating recombinant DNA technology.

9.3 PROCESSES OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY
Recombinant DNA technology involves several steps in specific
sequence such as isolation of DNA, fragmentation of DNA by
restriction endonucleases, isolation of a desired DNA fragment,
ligation of the DNA fragment into a vector, transferring the
recombinant DNA into the host, culturing the host cells in a
medium at large scale and extraction of the desired product.
Let us examine each of these steps in some details.

9.3.1 Isolation of the Genetic Material (DNA)
Recall that nucleic acid is the genetic material of all organisms
without exception. In majority of organisms this is
deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. In order to cut the DNA with
restriction enzymes, it needs to be in pure form, free from other
macro-molecules. Since the DNA is enclosed within the
membranes, we have to break the cell open to release DNA along
with other macromolecules such as RNA, proteins,
polysaccharides and also lipids. This can be achieved by treating
the bacterial cells/plant or animal tissue with enzymes such as          Figure 9.5 DNA that
                                                                         separates out can be
lysozyme (bacteria), cellulase (plant cells), chitinase (fungus).
                                                                         removed by spooling
You know that genes are located on long molecules of DNA
interwined with proteins such as histones. The RNA can be removed by                        171
treatment with ribonuclease whereas proteins can be removed by
treatment with protease. Other molecules can be removed by appropriate
treatments and purified DNA ultimately precipitates out after the addition
of chilled ethanol. This can be seen as collection of fine threads in the
suspension (Figure 9.5).

                     9.3.2 Cutting of DNA at Specific Locations
                     Restriction enzyme digestions are performed by incubating purified DNA
                     molecules with the restriction enzyme, at the optimal conditions for that
                     specific enzyme. Agarose gel electrophoresis is employed to check the
                     progression of a restriction enzyme digestion. DNA is a negatively charged
                     molecule, hence it moves towards the positive electrode (anode)
                     (Figure 9.3). The process is repeated with the vector DNA also.
                         The joining of DNA involves several processes. After having cut the
                     source DNA as well as the vector DNA with a specific restriction enzyme,
                     the cut out ‘gene of interest’ from the source DNA and the cut vector with
                     space are mixed and ligase is added. This results in the preparation of
                     recombinant DNA.

                     9.3.3 Amplification of Gene of Interest using PCR
                     PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction. In this reaction, multiple
                     copies of the gene (or DNA) of interest is synthesised in vitro using two

sets of primers (small chemically synthesised oligonucleotides that are
complementary to the regions of DNA) and the enzyme DNA polymerase.
The enzyme extends the primers using the nucleotides provided in the
reaction and the genomic DNA as template. If the process of replication
of DNA is repeated many times, the segment of DNA can be amplified
to approximately billion times, i.e., 1 billion copies are made. Such
repeated amplification is achieved by the use of a thermostable DNA
polymerase (isolated from a bacterium, Thermus aquaticus), which
remain active during the high temperature induced denaturation of
double stranded DNA. The amplified fragment if desired can now be
used to ligate with a vector for further cloning (Figure 9.6).

9.3.4     Insertion of Recombinant DNA into the Host
          Cell/Organism
There are several methods of introducing the ligated DNA into recipient
cells. Recipient cells after making them ‘competent’ to receive, take up
DNA present in its surrounding. So, if a recombinant DNA bearing gene
for resistance to an antibiotic (e.g., ampicillin) is transferred into E. coli
cells, the host cells become transformed into ampicillin-resistant cells. If
we spread the transformed cells on agar plates containing ampicillin, only
transformants will grow, untransformed recipient cells will die. Since, due
to ampicillin resistance gene, one is able to select a transformed cell in the
presence of ampicillin. The ampicillin resistance gene in this case is called
a selectable marker.

9.3.5 Obtaining the Foreign Gene Product
When you insert a piece of alien DNA into a cloning vector and transfer it
into a bacterial, plant or animal cell, the alien DNA gets multiplied. In
almost all recombinant technologies, the ultimate aim is to produce a
desirable protein. Hence, there is a need for the recombinant DNA to be
expressed. The foreign gene gets expressed under appropriate conditions.
The expression of foreign genes in host cells involve understanding many
technical details.
    After having cloned the gene of interest and having optimised the
conditions to induce the expression of the target protein, one has to
consider producing it on a large scale. Can you think of any reason
why there is a need for large-scale production? If any protein encoding
gene is expressed in a heterologous host, it is called a recombinant
protein. The cells harbouring cloned genes of interest may be grown
on a small scale in the laboratory. The cultures may be used for                 173
extracting the desired protein and then purifying it by using different
separation techniques.
    The cells can also be multiplied in a continuous culture system wherein
the used medium is drained out from one side while fresh medium is
added from the other to maintain the cells in their physiologically most

                          larger biomass leading to higher yields of desired protein.
                              Small volume cultures cannot yield appreciable quantities of products.
                          To produce in large quantities, the development of bioreactors, where
                          large volumes (100-1000 litres) of culture can be processed, was required.
                          Thus, bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are
                          biologically converted into specific products, individual enzymes, etc.,
                          using microbial plant, animal or human cells. A bioreactor provides the
                          optimal conditions for achieving the desired product by providing
                          optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, substrate, salts, vitamins,
                          oxygen).
                              The most commonly used bioreactors are of stirring type, which are
                          shown in Figure 9.7.

              sterile air bubbles are sparged


                              A stirred-tank reactor is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to
                          facilitate the mixing of the reactor contents. The stirrer facilitates even
                          mixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor. Alternatively
                          air can be bubbled through the reactor. If you look at the figure closely
                          you will see that the bioreactor has an agitator system, an oxygen delivery
                          system and a foam control system, a temperature control system, pH
174                       control system and sampling ports so that small volumes of the culture
                          can be withdrawn periodically.

product. The processes include separation and purification, which are
collectively referred to as downstream processing. The product has to be
formulated with suitable preservatives. Such formulation has to undergo
thorough clinical trials as in case of drugs. Strict quality control testing
for each product is also required. The downstream processing and quality
control testing vary from product to product.




                                 SUMMARY
      Biotechnology deals with large scale production and marketing of
      products and processes using live organisms, cells or enzymes.
      Modern biotechnology using genetically modified organisms was
      made possible only when man learnt to alter the chemistry of DNA
      and construct recombinant DNA. This key process is called
      recombinant DNA technology or genetic engineering. This process
      involves the use of restriction endonucleases, DNA ligase,
      appropriate plasmid or viral vectors to isolate and ferry the foreign
      DNA into host organisms, expression of the foreign gene, purification
      of the gene product, i.e., the functional protein and finally making a
      suitable formulation for marketing. Large scale production involves
      use of bioreactors.

                                 processed food, bioremediation, waste treatment, and
10.4 Ethical Issues
                                 energy production. Three critical research areas of
                                 biotechnology are:
                                    (i) Providing the best catalyst in the form of improved
                                        organism usually a microbe or pure enzyme.
                                   (ii) Creating optimal conditions through engineering for
                                        a catalyst to act, and
                                  (iii) Downstream processing technologies to purify the
                                        protein/organic compound.
                                      Let us now learn how human beings have used
                                 biotechnology to improve the quality of human life,
                                 especially in the field of food production and health.

                                 for increasing food production
                                    (i) agro-chemical based agriculture;

                  (ii) organic agriculture; and
                 (iii) genetically engineered crop-based agriculture.
                    The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but yet
                it was not enough to feed the growing human population. Increased yields
                have partly been due to the use of improved crop varieties, but mainly
                due to the use of better management practices and use of agrochemicals
                (fertilisers and pesticides). However, for farmers in the developing world,
                agrochemicals are often too expensive, and further increases in yield with
                existing varieties are not possible using conventional breeding.
                As traditional breeding techniques failed to keep pace with demand and
                to provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement,
                another technology called tissue culture got developed. What does
                tissue culture mean? It was learnt by scientists, during 1950s, that
                whole plants could be regenerated from explants, i.e., any part of a
                plant taken out and grown in a test tube, under sterile conditions in
                special nutrient media. This capacity to generate a whole plant from
                any cell/explant is called totipotency. You will learn how to accomplish
                this in higher classes. It is important to stress here that the nutrient
                medium must provide a carbon source such as sucrose and also
                inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators like auxins,
                cytokinins etc. By application of these methods it is possible to achieve
                propagation of a large number of plants in very short durations. This
                method of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture is
                called micro-propagation. Each of these plants will be genetically
                identical to the original plant from which they were grown, i.e., they are
                somaclones. Many important food plants like tomato, banana, apple,
                etc., have been produced on commercial scale using this method. Try to
                visit a tissue culture laboratory with your teacher to better understand
                and appreciate the process.
                    Another important application of the method is the recovery of
                healthy plants from diseased plants. Even if the plant is infected with a
                virus, the meristem (apical and axillary) is free of virus. Hence, one
                can remove the meristem and grow it in vitro to obtain virus-free plants.
                Scientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane,
                potato, etc.
178                 Scientists have even isolated single cells from plants and after
                digesting their cell walls have been able to isolate naked protoplasts
                (surrounded by plasma membranes). Isolated protoplasts from two
                different varieties of plants – each having a desirable character – can be
                fused to get hybrid protoplasts, which can be further grown to form a
                new plant. These hybrids are called somatic hybrids while the process

BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS


is called somatic hybridisation. Imagine a situation when a protoplast
of tomato is fused with that of potato, and then they are grown – to form
new hybrid plants combining tomato and potato characteristics. Well,
this has been achieved – resulting in formation of pomato; unfortunately
this plant did not have all the desired combination of characteristics for
its commercial utilisation.
   Is there any alternative path that our understanding of genetics can
show so that farmers may obtain maximum yield from their fields? Is
there a way to minimise the use of fertilisers and chemicals so that their
harmful effects on the environment are reduced? Use of genetically
modified crops is a possible solution.
   Plants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by
manipulation are called Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). GM
plants have been useful in many ways. Genetic modification has:
   (i)made crops more tolerant to abiotic stresses (cold, drought, salt, heat).
  (ii)reduced reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops).
 (iii)helped to reduce post harvest losses.
 (iv) increased efficiency of mineral usage by plants (this prevents early
      exhaustion of fertility of soil).
  (v) enhanced nutritional value of food, e.g., golden rice, i.e., Vitamin ‘A’
      enriched rice.
    In addition to these uses, GM has been used to create tailor-made
plants to supply alternative resources to industries, in the form of starches,
fuels and pharmaceuticals.
    Some of the applications of biotechnology in agriculture that you will
study in detail are the production of pest resistant plants, which could
decrease the amount of pesticide used. Bt toxin is produced by a
bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt for short). Bt toxin gene has
been cloned from the bacteria and been expressed in plants to provide
resistance to insects without the need for insecticides; in effect created a
bio-pesticide. Examples are Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and
soyabean etc.
Bt Cotton: Some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that
kill certain insects such as lepidopterans (tobacco budworm, armyworm),
coleopterans (beetles) and dipterans (flies, mosquitoes). B. thuringiensis
forms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth. These
crystals contain a toxic insecticidal protein. Why does this toxin not kill
the Bacillus? Actually, the Bt toxin protein exist as inactive protoxins but      179
once an insect ingest the inactive toxin, it is converted into an active form
of toxin due to the alkaline pH of the gut which solubilise the crystals.
The activated toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells and
create pores that cause cell swelling and lysis and eventually cause death
of the insect.

                    Specific Bt toxin genes were isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis and
                incorporated into the several crop plants such as cotton (Figure 10.1).
                The choice of genes depends upon the crop and the targeted pest, as
                most Bt toxins are insect-group specific. The toxin is coded by a gene
                cryIAc named cry. There are a number of them, for example, the proteins
                encoded by the genes cryIAc and cryIIAb control the cotton bollworms,
                that of cryIAb controls corn borer.

                Pest Resistant Plants: Several nematodes parasitise a wide variety of
                plants and animals including human beings. A nematode Meloidegyne
                incognitia infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction
                in yield. A novel strategy was adopted to prevent this infestation which
                was based on the process of RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi takes place
                in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense. This method
                involves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA
                molecule that binds to and prevents translation of the mRNA (silencing).
                The source of this complementary RNA could be from an infection by
                viruses having RNA genomes or mobile genetic elements (transposons)
                that replicate via an RNA intermediate.
                    Using Agrobacterium vectors, nematode-specific genes were
                introduced into the host plant (Figure 10.2). The introduction of DNA
180             was such that it produced both sense and anti-sense RNA in the host
                cells. These two RNA’s being complementary to each other formed a double
                stranded (dsRNA) that initiated RNAi and thus, silenced the specific mRNA
                of the nematode. The consequence was that the parasite could not survive
                in a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA. The transgenic
                plant therefore got itself protected from the parasite (Figure 10.2).

10.2 BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS                 IN   MEDICINE
The recombinant DNA technological processes have made immense impact
in the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe and more
effective therapeutic drugs. Further, the recombinant therapeutics do not
induce unwanted immunological responses as is common in case of
similar products isolated from non-human sources. At present, about
30 recombinant therapeutics have been approved for human-use the
world over. In India, 12 of these are presently being marketed.

10.2.1 Genetically Engineered Insulin
Management of adult-onset diabetes is possible by taking insulin at
regular time intervals. What would a diabetic patient do if enough human-
insulin was not available? If you discuss this, you would soon realise
that one would have to isolate and use insulin from other animals. Would
the insulin isolated from other animals be just as effective as that
secreted by the human body itself and would it not elicit an immune
response in the human body? Now, imagine if bacterium were available
that could make human insulin. Suddenly the whole process becomes
so simple. You can easily grow a large quantity of the bacteria and make
as much insulin as you need.
    Think about whether insulin can be orally administered to diabetic
people or not. Why?
                                                                                                181
    Insulin used for diabetes was earlier extracted from pancreas of
slaughtered cattle and pigs. Insulin from an animal source, though caused
some patients to develop allergy or other types of reactions to the foreign
protein. Insulin consists of two short polypeptide chains: chain A
and chain B, that are linked together by disulphide bridges (Figure 10.3).

                                        In mammals, including humans, insulin is synthesised
                                        as a pro-hormone (like a pro-enzyme, the pro-hormone
                                        also needs to be processed before it becomes a fully mature
                                        and functional hormone) which contains an extra stretch
                                        called the C peptide. This C peptide is not present in the
                                        mature insulin and is removed during maturation into
                                        insulin.The main challenge for production of insulin using
                                        rDNA techniques was getting insulin assembled into a
                                        mature form. In 1983, Eli Lilly an American company
                                        prepared two DNA sequences corresponding to A and B,
                                        chains of human insulin and introduced them in plasmids
                                        of E. coli to produce insulin chains. Chains A and B were
Figure 10.3 Maturation of
            pro-insulin into insulin    produced separately, extracted and combined by creating
            (simplified)                disulfide bonds to form human insulin.

                       10.2.2 Gene Therapy
                       If a person is born with a hereditary disease, can a corrective therapy
                       be taken for such a disease? Gene therapy is an attempt to do this.
                       Gene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a
                       gene defect that has been diagnosed in a child/embryo. Here genes
                       are inserted into a person’s cells and tissues to treat a disease.
                       Correction of a genetic defect involves delivery of a normal gene into
                       the individual or embryo to take over the function of and compensate
                       for the non-functional gene.
                           The first clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4-year old girl
                       with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. This enzyme is crucial for
                       the immune system to function. The disorder is caused due to the deletion
                       of the gene for adenosine deaminase. In some children ADA deficiency
                       can be cured by bone marrow transplantation; in others it can be treated
                       by enzyme replacement therapy, in which functional ADA is given to the
                       patient by injection. But the problem with both of these approaches that
                       they are not completely curative. As a first step towards gene therapy,
                       lymphocytes from the blood of the patient are grown in a culture outside
                       the body. A functional ADA cDNA (using a retroviral vector) is then
                       introduced into these lymphocytes, which are subsequently returned to
                       the patient. However, as these cells are not immortal, the patient requires
                       periodic infusion of such genetically engineered lymphocytes. However, if
                       the gene isolate from marrow cells producing ADA is introduced into cells
182                    at early embryonic stages, it could be a permanent cure.

                       10.2.3 Molecular Diagnosis
                       You know that for effective treatment of a disease, early diagnosis and
                       understanding its pathophysiology is very important. Using conventional
                       methods of diagnosis (serum and urine analysis, etc.) early detection is

BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS


not possible. Recombinant DNA technology, Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) and Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay (ELISA) are some of
the techniques that serve the purpose of early diagnosis.
    Presence of a pathogen (bacteria, viruses, etc.) is normally suspected
only when the pathogen has produced a disease symptom. By this time
the concentration of pathogen is already very high in the body. However,
very low concentration of a bacteria or virus (at a time when the symptoms
of the disease are not yet visible) can be detected by amplification of their
nucleic acid by PCR. Can you explain how PCR can detect very low
amounts of DNA? PCR is now routinely used to detect HIV in suspected
AIDS patients. It is being used to detect mutations in genes in suspected
cancer patients too. It is a powerful techqnique to identify many other
genetic disorders.
    A single stranded DNA or RNA, tagged with a radioactive molecule
(probe) is allowed to hybridise to its complementary DNA in a clone of
cells followed by detection using autoradiography. The clone having the
mutated gene will hence not appear on the photographic film, because
the probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene.
    ELISA is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction.
Infection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens
(proteins, glycoproteins, etc.) or by detecting the antibodies synthesised
against the pathogen.

10.3 TRANSGENIC ANIMALS
Animals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express an
extra (foreign) gene are known as transgenic animals. Transgenic rats,
rabbits, pigs, sheep, cows and fish have been produced, although over
95 per cent of all existing transgenic animals are mice. Why are these
animals being produced? How can man benefit from such modifications?
Let us try and explore some of the common reasons:
   (i) Normal physiology and development: Transgenic animals can
       be specifically designed to allow the study of how genes are
       regulated, and how they affect the normal functions of the body
       and its development, e.g., study of complex factors involved in growth
       such as insulin-like growth factor. By introducing genes from other
       species that alter the formation of this factor and studying the
       biological effects that result, information is obtained about the
       biological role of the factor in the body.
  (ii) Study of disease: Many transgenic animals are designed to increase       183
       our understanding of how genes contribute to the development of
       disease. These are specially made to serve as models for human
       diseases so that investigation of new treatments for diseases is made
       possible. Today transgenic models exist for many human diseases
       such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s.

                                                                                     BIOLOGY


                 (iii) Biological products: Medicines required to treat certain human
                       diseases can contain biological products, but such products are
                       often expensive to make. Transgenic animals that produce useful
                       biological products can be created by the introduction of the portion
                       of DNA (or genes) which codes for a particular product such as
                       human protein (α-1-antitrypsin) used to treat emphysema. Similar
                       attempts are being made for treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU)
                       and cystic fibrosis. In 1997, the first transgenic cow, Rosie, produced
                       human protein-enriched milk (2.4 grams per litre). The milk
                       contained the human alpha-lactalbumin and was nutritionally a
                       more balanced product for human babies than natural cow-milk.
                 (iv) Vaccine safety: Transgenic mice are being developed for use in
                      testing the safety of vaccines before they are used on humans.
                      Transgenic mice are being used to test the safety of the polio vaccine.
                      If successful and found to be reliable, they could replace the use of
                      monkeys to test the safety of batches of the vaccine.
                  (v) Chemical safety testing: This is known as toxicity/safety testing.
                      The procedure is the same as that used for testing toxicity of drugs.
                      Transgenic animals are made that carry genes which make them more
                      sensitive to toxic substances than non-transgenic animals. They are
                      then exposed to the toxic substances and the effects studied. Toxicity
                      testing in such animals will allow us to obtain results in less time.

                10.4 ETHICAL ISSUES
                The manipulation of living organisms by the human race cannot go on
                any further, without regulation. Some ethical standards are required to
                evaluate the morality of all human activities that might help or harm living
                organisms.
                    Going beyond the morality of such issues, the biological significance
                of such things is also important. Genetic modification of organisms can
                have unpredicatable results when such organisms are introduced into
                the ecosystem.
                    Therefore, the Indian Government has set up organisations such as
                GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee), which will make
                decisions regarding the validity of GM research and the safety of
                introducing GM-organisms for public services.
                    The modification/usage of living organisms for public services (as food
                and medicine sources, for example) has also created problems with patents
184
                granted for the same.
                    There is growing public anger that certain companies are being
                granted patents for products and technologies that make use of the
                genetic materials, plants and other biological resources that have long
                been identified, developed and used by farmers and indigenous people
                of a specific region/country.

BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS


    Rice is an important food grain, the presence of which goes back
thousands of years in Asia’s agricultural history. There are an estimated
200,000 varieties of rice in India alone. The diversity of rice in India is
one of the richest in the world. Basmati rice is distinct for its unique
aroma and flavour and 27 documented varieties of Basmati are grown
in India. There is reference to Basmati in ancient texts, folklore and
poetry, as it has been grown for centuries. In 1997, an American
company got patent rights on Basmati rice through the US Patent and
Trademark Office. This allowed the company to sell a ‘new’ variety of
Basmati, in the US and abroad. This ‘new’ variety of Basmati had
actually been derived from Indian farmer’s varieties. Indian Basmati
was crossed with semi-dwarf varieties and claimed as an invention or
a novelty. The patent extends to functional equivalents, implying that
other people selling Basmati rice could be restricted by the patent.
Several attempts have also been made to patent uses, products and
processes based on Indian traditional herbal medicines, e.g., turmeric
neem. If we are not vigilant and we do not immediately counter these
patent applications, other countries/individuals may encash on our
rich legacy and we may not be able to do anything about it.
    Biopiracy is the term used to refer to the use of bio-resources by
multinational companies and other organisations without proper
authorisation from the countries and people concerned without
compensatory payment.
    Most of the industrialised nations are rich financially but poor in
biodiversity and traditional knowledge. In contrast the developing and
the underdeveloped world is rich in biodiversity and traditional
knowledge related to bio-resources. Traditional knowledge related to
bio-resources can be exploited to develop modern applications and
can also be used to save time, effort and expenditure during their
commercialisation.
    There has been growing realisation of the injustice, inadequate
compensation and benefit sharing between developed and developing
countries. Therefore, some nations are developing laws to prevent such
unauthorised exploitation of their bio-resources and traditional
knowledge.
    The Indian Parliament has recently cleared the second amendment
of the Indian Patents Bill, that takes such issues into consideration,
including patent terms emergency provisions and research and
development initiative.                                                       185

                                                   SUMMARY
                  Biotechnology has given to humans several useful products by using
                  microbes, plant, animals and their metabolic machinery. Techniques
                  of tissue culture and somatic hybridisation offer vast potential for
                  manipulation of plants in vitro to produce new varieties. Recombinant
                  DNA technology has made it possible to engineer microbes, plants
                  and animals such that they have novel capabilities. Genetically
                  Modified Organisms have been created by using methods other than
                  natural methods to transfer one or more genes from one organism to
                  another, generally using techniques such as recombinant DNA
                  technology.
                      GM plants have been useful in increasing crop yields, reduce post-
                  harvest losses and make crops more tolerant of stresses. There are
                  several GM crop plants with improved nutritional value of foods and
                  reduced the reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops).
                      Recombinant DNA technological processes have made immense
                  impact in the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe
                  and more effective therapeutics. Since the recombinant therapeutics
                  are identical to human proteins, they do not induce unwanted
                  immunological responses and are free from risk of infection as was
                  observed in case of similar products isolated from non-human sources.
                  Human insulin is made in bacteria yet its structure is absolutely
                  identical to that of the natural molecule.
                      Transgenic animals are also used to understand how genes
                  contribute to the development of a disease by serving as models for
                  human diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis
                  and Alzheimer’s.
                      Gene therapy is the insertion of genes into an individual’s cells
                  and tissues to treat diseases especially hereditary diseases. It does
                  so by replacing a defective mutant allele with a functional one or
                  gene targeting which involves gene amplification. Viruses that attack
                  their hosts and introduce their genetic material into the host cell as
                  part of their replication cycle are used as vectors to transfer healthy
                  genes or more recently portions of genes.
                      The current interest in the manipulation of microbes, plants, and
                  animals has raised serious ethical questions.

                                 and hence behave like organised wholes, i.e., population,
                                 community, ecosystem or even as the whole biosphere.
                                 Ecology explains to us all this. A particular aspect of this is the
                                 study of anthropogenic environmental degradation and the
                                 socio-political issues it has raised. This unit describes as well as
                                 takes a critical view of the above aspects.

                Ramdeo Misra is revered as the Father of Ecology in India. Born on 26 August
                1908, Ramdeo Misra obtained Ph.D in Ecology (1937) under Prof. W. H. Pearsall,
                FRS, from Leeds University in UK. He established teaching and research in
                ecology at the Department of Botany of the Banaras Hindu University,
                Varanasi. His research laid the foundations for understanding of tropical
                communities and their succession, environmental responses of plant
                populations and productivity and nutrient cycling in tropical forest and
                grassland ecosystems. Misra formulated the first postgraduate course in
                ecology in India. Over 50 scholars obtained Ph. D degree under his supervision
                and moved on to other universities and research institutes to initiate ecology
                teaching and research across the country.
                     He was honoured with the Fellowships of the Indian National Science
RAMDEO MISRA    Academy and World Academy of Arts and Science, and the prestigious Sanjay
 (1908-1998)
                Gandhi Award in Environment and Ecology. Due to his efforts, the
                Government of India established the National Committee for Environmental
                Planning and Coordination (1972) which, in later years, paved the way
                for the establishment of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (1984).

ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS


11.1 Populations

                                Our living world is fascinatingly diverse and amazingly
                                complex. We can try to understand its complexity by
                                investigating processes at various levels of biological
                                organisation–macromolecules, cells, tissues, organs,
                                individual organisms, population, communities,
                                ecosystems and biomes. At any level of biological
                                organisation we can ask two types of questions – for
                                example, when we hear the bulbul singing early morning
                                in the garden, we may ask – ‘How does the bird sing ?’
                                Or, ‘Why does the bird sing ?’ The ‘how-type’ questions
                                seek the mechanism behind the process while the ‘why-
                                type’ questions seek the significance of the process. For
                                the first question in our example, the answer might be in
                                terms of the operation of the voice box and the vibrating
                                bone in the bird, whereas for the second question the
                                answer may lie in the bird’s need to communicate with its
                                mate during breeding season. When you observe nature
                                around you with a scientific frame of mind you will
                                certainly come up with many interesting questions of both
                                types - Why are night-blooming flowers generally white?
                                How does the bee know which flower has nectar? Why
                                does cactus have so many thorns? How does the chick
                                spures recognise her own mother ?, and so on.

ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS


   You have already learnt in previous classes that Ecology is a subject
which studies the interactions among organisms and between the
organism and its physical (abiotic) environment.
   Ecology is basically concerned with four levels of biological
organisation – organisms, populations, communities and biomes. In this
chapter we explore ecology at population levels.

11.1 POPULATIONS
11.1.1 Population Attributes
In nature, we rarely find isolated, single individuals of any species; majority
of them live in groups in a well defined geographical area, share or compete
for similar resources, potentially interbreed and thus constitute a
population. Although the term interbreeding implies sexual reproduction,
a group of individuals resulting from even asexual reproduction is also
generally considered a population for the purpose of ecological studies.
All the cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teakwood
trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate and lotus plants in a
pond, are some examples of a population. In earlier chapters you have
learnt that although an individual organism is the one that has to cope
with a changed environment, it is at the population level that natural
selection operates to evolve the desired traits. Population ecology is,
therefore, an important area because it links ecology to population genetics
and evolution.
     A population has certain attributes whereas, an individual organism
does not. An individual may have births and deaths, but a population has
birth rates and death rates. In a population these rates refer to per capita
births and deaths. The rates, hence, expressed are change in numbers
(increase or decrease) with respect to members of the population. Here is an
example. If in a pond there were 20 lotus plants last year and through
reproduction 8 new plants are added, taking the current population to 28,
we calculate the birth rate as 8/20 = 0.4 offspring per lotus per year. If 4
individuals in a laboratory population of 40 fruitflies died during a specified
time interval, say a week, the death rate in the population during that period
is 4/40 = 0.1 individuals per fruitfly per week.
     Another attribute characteristic of a population is sex ratio. An
individual is either a male or a female but a population has a sex ratio
(e.g., 60 per cent of the population are females and 40 per cent males).
     A population at any given time is composed of individuals of
different ages. If the age distribution (per cent individuals of a given          191
age or age group) is plotted for the population, the resulting structure
is called an age pyramid (Figure 11.1). For human population, the
age pyramids generally show age distribution of males and females in
a diagram. The shape of the pyramids reflects the growth status of
the population - (a) whether it is growing, (b) stable or (c) declining.

             Figure 11.1 Representation of age pyramids for human population

                     The size of the population tells us a lot about its status in the habitat.
                Whatever ecological processes we wish to investigate in a population, be
                it the outcome of competition with another species, the impact of a
                predator or the effect of a pesticide application, we always evaluate them
                in terms of any change in the population size. The size, in nature, could
                be as low as <10 (Siberian cranes at Bharatpur wetlands in any year) or
                go into millions (Chlamydomonas in a pond). Population size, technically
                called population density (designated as N), need not necessarily be
                measured in numbers only. Although total number is generally the most
                appropriate measure of population density, it is in some cases either
                meaningless or difficult to determine. In an area, if there are 200 carrot
                grass (Parthenium hysterophorus) plants but only a single huge banyan
                tree with a large canopy, stating that the population density of banyan is
                low relative to that of carrot grass amounts to underestimating the
                enormous role of the Banyan in that community. In such cases, the per
                cent cover or biomass is a more meaningful measure of the population
                size. Total number is again not an easily adoptable measure if the
                population is huge and counting is impossible or very time-consuming.
                If you have a dense laboratory culture of bacteria in a petri dish what is
                the best measure to report its density? Sometimes, for certain ecological
                investigations, there is no need to know the absolute population densities;
                relative densities serve the purpose equally well. For instance, the number
                of fish caught per trap is good enough measure of its total population
                density in the lake. We are mostly obliged to estimate population sizes
                indirectly, without actually counting them or seeing them. The tiger census
                in our national parks and tiger reserves is often based on pug marks and
                fecal pellets.

                11.1.2 Population Growth
                The size of a population for any species is not a static parameter. It keeps
192             changing with time, depending on various factors including food
                availability, predation pressure and adverse weather. In fact, it is these
                changes in population density that give us some idea of what is happening
                to the population – whether it is flourishing or declining. Whatever might
                be the ultimate reasons, the density of a population in a given habitat
                during a given period, fluctuates due to changes in four basic processes,

two of which (natality and immigration) contribute to an increase in
population density and two (mortality and emigration) to a decrease.
   (i) Natality refers to the number of births during a given period in the
       population that are added to the initial density.
  (ii) Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given
       period.
 (iii) Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species that
       have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period
       under consideration.
 (iv) Emigration is the number of individuals of the population who
       left the habitat and gone elsewhere during the time period under
       consideration.




                                            Figure 11.2

So, if N is the population density at time t, then its density at time t +1 is
                        Nt+1 = Nt + [(B + I) – (D + E)]
    You can see from the above equation (Fig. 11.2) that population
density will increase if the number of births plus the number of immigrants      193
(B + I) is more than the number of deaths plus the number of emigrants
(D + E). Under normal conditions, births and deaths are the most
important factors influencing population density, the other two factors
assuming importance only under special conditions. For instance, if a
new habitat is just being colonised, immigration may contribute more
significantly to population growth than birth rates.

                      Growth Models : Does the growth of a population with time show any
                      specific and predictable pattern? We have been concerned about unbridled
                      human population growth and problems created by it in our country
                      and it is therefore natural for us to be curious if different animal
                      populations in nature behave the same way or show some restraints on
                      growth. Perhaps we can learn a lesson or two from nature on how to
                      control population growth.
                        (i) Exponential growth : Resource (food and space) availability is
                             obviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population.
                             Ideally, when resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species
                             has the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number,
                             as Darwin observed while developing his theory of natural selection.
                             Then the population grows in an exponential or geometric fashion.
                             If in a population of size N, the birth rates (not total number but per
                             capita births) are represented as b and death rates (again, per capita
                             death rates) as d, then the increase or decrease in N during a unit
                             time period t (dN/dt) will be
                                     dN/dt = (b – d) × N
                                     Let (b–d) = r, then
                                     dN/dt = rN
                                               The r in this equation is called the ‘intrinsic rate of
                                               natural increase’ and is a very important parameter
                                               chosen for assessing impacts of any biotic or abiotic
                                               factor on population growth.
                                               To give you some idea about the magnitude of r
                                               values, for the Norway rat the r is 0.015, and for
                                               the flour beetle it is 0.12. In 1981, the r value for
                                               human population in India was 0.0205. Find out
                                               what the current r value is. For calculating it, you
                                               need to know the birth rates and death rates.
                                               The above equation describes the exponential or
                                               geometric growth pattern of a population (Figure

     Darwin showed how even a slow growing animal like elephant could
     reach enormous numbers in the absence of checks. The following is
     an anecdote popularly narrated to demonstrate dramatically how
     fast a huge population could build up when growing exponentially.
 The king and the minister sat for a chess game. The king, confident
 of winning the game, was ready to accept any bet proposed by the
 minister. The minister humbly said that if he won, he wanted only
 some wheat grains, the quantity of which is to be calculated by
 placing on the chess board one grain in Square 1, then two in Square
 2, then four in Square 3, and eight in Square 4, and so on, doubling
 each time the previous quantity of wheat on the next square until all the
 64 squares were filled. The king accepted the seemingly silly bet and
 started the game, but unluckily for him, the minister won. The king felt that
 fulfilling the minister’s bet was so easy. He started with a single
 grain on the first square and proceeded to fill the other squares
 following minister’s suggested procedure, but by the time he covered
 half the chess board, the king realised to his dismay that all the
 wheat produced in his entire kingdom pooled together would still be
 inadequate to cover all the 64 squares. Now think of a tiny
 Paramecium starting with just one individual and through binary
 fission, doubling in numbers every day, and imagine what a mind-
 boggling population size it would reach in 64 days. (provided food
 and space remain unlimited)
 (ii) Logistic growth: No population of any species in nature has at its
      disposal unlimited resources to permit exponential growth. This
      leads to competition between individuals for limited resources.
      Eventually, the ‘fittest’ individual will survive and reproduce. The
      governments of many countries have also realised this fact and
      introduced various restraints with a view to limit human population
      growth. In nature, a given habitat has enough resources to support
      a maximum possible number, beyond which no further growth is
      possible. Let us call this limit as nature’s carrying capacity (K) for
      that species in that habitat.
          A population growing in a habitat with limited resources show
      initially a lag phase, followed by phases of acceleration and
      deceleration and finally an asymptote, when the population density
      reaches the carrying capacity. A plot of N in relation to time (t)
      results in a sigmoid curve. This type of population growth is called       195
      Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth (Figure 11.3) and is described by

                11.1.3 Life History Variation
                Populations evolve to maximise their reproductive fitness, also called
                Darwinian fitness (high r value), in the habitat in which they live. Under
                a particular set of selection pressures, organisms evolve towards the most
                efficient reproductive strategy. Some organisms breed only once in their
                lifetime (Pacific salmon fish, bamboo) while others breed many times
                during their lifetime (most birds and mammals). Some produce a large
                number of small-sized offspring (Oysters, pelagic fishes) while others
                produce a small number of large-sized offspring (birds, mammals). So,
                which is desirable for maximising fitness? Ecologists suggest that life
                history traits of organisms have evolved in relation to the constraints
                imposed by the abiotic and biotic components of the habitat in which
                they live. Evolution of life history traits in different species is currently an
                important area of research being conducted by ecologists.

                11.1.4 Population Interactions
                Can you think of any natural habitat on earth that is inhabited just by a
                single species? There is no such habitat and such a situation is even
                inconceivable. For any species, the minimal requirement is one more
                species on which it can feed. Even a plant species, which makes its own
                food, cannot survive alone; it needs soil microbes to break down the organic
                matter in soil and return the inorganic nutrients for absorption. And then,
                how will the plant manage pollination without an animal agent? It is
                obvious that in nature, animals, plants and microbes do not and cannot
                live in isolation but interact in various ways to form a biological
                community. Even in minimal communities, many interactive linkages
                exist, although all may not be readily apparent.
196                 Interspecific interactions arise from the interaction of populations of
                two different species. They could be beneficial, detrimental or neutral
                (neither harm nor benefit) to one of the species or both. Assigning a ‘+’
                sign for beneficial interaction, ‘-’ sign for detrimental and 0 for neutral
                interaction, let us look at all the possible outcomes of interspecific
                interactions (Table11.1).

       –                         0                     Amensalism


    Both the species benefit in mutualism and both lose in competition in
their interactions with each other. In both parasitism and predation only
one species benefits (parasite and predator, respectively) and the interaction
is detrimental to the other species (host and prey, respectively).
The interaction where one species is benefitted and the other is neither
benefitted nor harmed is called commensalism. In amensalism on
the other hand one species is harmed whereas the other is
unaffected. Predation, parasitism and commensalism share a common
characteristic– the interacting species live closely together.
  (i) Predation: What would happen to all the energy fixed by
      autotrophic organisms if the community has no animals to eat the
      plants? You can think of predation as nature’s way of transferring
      to higher trophic levels the energy fixed by plants. When we think
      of predator and prey, most probably it is the tiger and the deer that
      readily come to our mind, but a sparrow eating any seed is no less
      a predator. Although animals eating plants are categorised
      separately as herbivores, they are, in a broad ecological context,
      not very different from predators.
            Besides acting as ‘conduits’ for energy transfer across trophic
      levels, predators play other important roles. They keep prey
      populations under control. But for predators, prey species could
      achieve very high population densities and cause ecosystem
      instability. When certain exotic species are introduced into a
      geographical area, they become invasive and start spreading fast
      because the invaded land does not have its natural predators. The
      prickly pear cactus introduced into Australia in the early 1920’s          197
      caused havoc by spreading rapidly into millions of hectares of
      rangeland. Finally, the invasive cactus was brought under control
      only after a cactus-feeding predator (a moth) from its natural habitat
      was introduced into the country. Biological control methods adopted
      in agricultural pest control are based on the ability of the predator

                      to regulate prey population. Predators also help in maintaining
                      species diversity in a community, by reducing the intensity of
                      competition among competing prey species. In the rocky intertidal
                      communities of the American Pacific Coast the starfish Pisaster is
                      an important predator. In a field experiment, when all the starfish
                      were removed from an enclosed intertidal area, more than 10 species
                      of invertebrates became extinct within a year, because of inter-
                      specific competition.
                          If a predator is too efficient and overexploits its prey, then the
                      prey might become extinct and following it, the predator will also
                      become extinct for lack of food. This is the reason why predators in
                      nature are ‘prudent’. Prey species have evolved various defenses to
                      lessen the impact of predation. Some species of insects and frogs
                      are cryptically-coloured (camouflaged) to avoid being detected easily
                      by the predator. Some are poisonous and therefore avoided by the
                      predators. The Monarch butterfly is highly distasteful to its predator
                      (bird) because of a special chemical present in its body.
                      Interestingly, the butterfly acquires this chemical during its
                      caterpillar stage by feeding on a poisonous weed.
                          For plants, herbivores are the predators. Nearly 25 per cent of
                      all insects are known to be phytophagous (feeding on plant sap
                      and other parts of plants). The problem is particularly severe for
                      plants because, unlike animals, they cannot run away from their
                      predators. Plants therefore have evolved an astonishing variety of
                      morphological and chemical defences against herbivores. Thorns
                      (Acacia, Cactus) are the most common morphological means of
                      defence. Many plants produce and store chemicals that make the
                      herbivore sick when they are eaten, inhibit feeding or digestion,
                      disrupt its reproduction or even kill it. You must have seen the
                      weed Calotropis growing in abandoned fields. The plant produces
                      highly poisonous cardiac glycosides and that is why you never see
                      any cattle or goats browsing on this plant. A wide variety of chemical
                      substances that we extract from plants on a commercial scale
                      (nicotine, caffeine, quinine, strychnine, opium, etc.,) are produced
                      by them actually as defences against grazers and browsers.
                 (ii) Competition: When Darwin spoke of the struggle for existence and
                      survival of the fittest in nature, he was convinced that interspecific
                      competition is a potent force in organic evolution. It is generally
198                   believed that competition occurs when closely related species
                      compete for the same resources that are limiting, but this is not
                      entirely true. Firstly, totally unrelated species could also compete
                      for the same resource. For instance, in some shallow South
                      American lakes, visiting flamingoes and resident fishes compete for
                      their common food, the zooplankton in the lake. Secondly,

ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS


       resources need not be limiting for competition to occur; in
       interference competition, the feeding efficiency of one species might
       be reduced due to the interfering and inhibitory presence of the
       other species, even if resources (food and space) are abundant.
       Therefore, competition is best defined as a process in which the
       fitness of one species (measured in terms of its ‘r’ the intrinsic rate
       of increase) is significantly lower in the presence of another species.
       It is relatively easy to demonstrate in laboratory experiments, as
       Gause and other experimental ecologists did, when resources are
       limited the competitively superior species will eventually eliminate
       the other species, but evidence for such competitive exclusion
       occurring in nature is not always conclusive. Strong and persuasive
       circumstantial evidence does exist however in some cases. The
       Abingdon tortoise in Galapagos Islands became extinct within a
       decade after goats were introduced on the island, apparently due
       to the greater browsing efficiency of the goats. Another evidence for
       the occurrence of competition in nature comes from what is called
       ‘competitive release’. A species whose distribution is restricted to a
       small geographical area because of the presence of a competitively
       superior species, is found to expand its distributional range
       dramatically when the competing species is experimentally removed.
       Connell’s elegant field experiments showed that on the rocky sea
       coasts of Scotland, the larger and competitively superior barnacle
       Balanus dominates the intertidal area, and excludes the smaller
       barnacle Chathamalus from that zone. In general, herbivores and
       plants appear to be more adversely affected by competition than
       carnivores.
            Gause’s ‘Competitive Exclusion Principle’ states that two closely
       related species competing for the same resources cannot co-exist
       indefinitely and the competitively inferior one will be eliminated
       eventually. This may be true if resources are limiting, but not
       otherwise. More recent studies do not support such gross
       generalisations about competition. While they do not rule out the
       occurrence of interspecific competition in nature, they point out
       that species facing competition might evolve mechanisms that
       promote co-existence rather than exclusion. One such mechanism
       is ‘resource partitioning’. If two species compete for the same
       resource, they could avoid competition by choosing, for instance,
       different times for feeding or different foraging patterns. MacArthur     199
       showed that five closely related species of warblers living on the
       same tree were able to avoid competition and co-exist due to
       behavioural differences in their foraging activities.
 (iii) Parasitism: Considering that the parasitic mode of life ensures
       free lodging and meals, it is not surprising that parasitism has

                      evolved in so many taxonomic groups from plants to higher
                      vertebrates. Many parasites have evolved to be host-specific (they
                      can parasitise only a single species of host) in such a way that
                      both host and the parasite tend to co-evolve; that is, if the host
                      evolves special mechanisms for rejecting or resisting the parasite,
                      the parasite has to evolve mechanisms to counteract and neutralise
                      them, in order to be successful with the same host species. In
                      accordance with their life styles, parasites evolved special
                      adaptations such as the loss of unnecessary sense organs, presence
                      of adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of
                      digestive system and high reproductive capacity. The life cycles of
                      parasites are often complex, involving one or two intermediate hosts
                      or vectors to facilitate parasitisation of its primary host. The human
                      liver fluke (a trematode parasite) depends on two intermediate
                      hosts (a snail and a fish) to complete its life cycle. The malarial
                      parasite needs a vector (mosquito) to spread to other hosts.
                      Majority of the parasites harm the host; they may reduce the
                      survival, growth and reproduction of the host and reduce its
                      population density. They might render the host more vulnerable
                      to predation by making it physically weak. Do you believe that
                      an ideal parasite should be able to thrive within the host without
                      harming it? Then why didn’t natural selection lead to the
                      evolution of such totally harmless parasites?
                          Parasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism
                      are called ectoparasites. The most familiar examples of this group
                      are the lice on humans and ticks on dogs. Many marine fish are
                      infested with ectoparasitic copepods. Cuscuta, a parasitic plant
                      that is commonly found growing on hedge plants, has lost its
                      chlorophyll and leaves in the course of evolution. It derives its
                      nutrition from the host plant which it parasitises. The female
                      mosquito is not considered a parasite, although it needs our blood
                      for reproduction. Can you explain why?
                          In contrast, endoparasites are those that live inside the host
                      body at different sites (liver, kidney, lungs, red blood cells, etc.).
                      The life cycles of endoparasites are more complex because of their
                      extreme specialisation. Their morphological and anatomical
                      features are greatly simplified while emphasising their reproductive
200                   potential.
                          Brood parasitism in birds is a fascinating example of
                      parasitism in which the parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of
                      its host and lets the host incubate them. During the course of
                      evolution, the eggs of the parasitic bird have evolved to resemble
                      the host’s egg in size and colour to reduce the chances of the host

      to follow the movements of the cuckoo (koel) and the crow in your
      neighborhood park during the breeding season (spring to summer)
      and watch brood parasitism in action.
 (iv) Commensalism: This is the interaction in which one species benefits
      and the other is neither harmed nor benefited. An orchid growing
      as an epiphyte on a mango branch, and barnacles growing on the
      back of a whale benefit while neither the mango tree nor the whale
      derives any apparent benefit. The cattle egret and grazing cattle in
      close association, a sight you are most likely to catch if you live in
      farmed rural areas, is a classic example of commensalism. The
      egrets always forage close to where the cattle are grazing because
      the cattle, as they move, stir up and flush out insects from the
      vegetation that otherwise might be difficult for the egrets to find
      and catch. Another example of commensalism is the interaction
      between sea anemone that has stinging tentacles and the clown
      fish that lives among them. The fish gets protection from predators
      which stay away from the stinging tentacles. The anemone does not
      appear to derive any benefit by hosting the clown fish.

     essential nutrients from the soil while the plant in turn provides the

                                The most spectacular and evolutionarily fascinating examples
                            of mutualism are found in plant-animal relationships. Plants need
                            the help of animals for pollinating their flowers and dispersing their
                            seeds. Animals obviously have to be paid ‘fees’ for the services that
                            plants expect from them. Plants offer rewards or fees in the form of
                            pollen and nectar for pollinators and juicy and nutritious fruits for
                            seed dispersers. But the mutually beneficial system should also
                            be safeguarded against ‘cheaters’, for example, animals that try to
                            steal nectar without aiding in pollination. Now you can see why
                            plant-animal interactions often involve co-evolution of the
                            mutualists, that is, the evolutions of the flower and its pollinator
                            species are tightly linked with one another. In many species of fig
                            trees, there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator
                            species of wasp (Figure 11.4). It means that a given fig species can
                            be pollinated only by its ‘partner’ wasp species and no other species.
                            The female wasp uses the fruit not only as an oviposition (egg-laying)
                            site but uses the developing seeds within the fruit for nourishing
                                         its larvae. The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescence while
                                         searching for suitable egg-laying sites. In return for the
                                         favour of pollination the fig offers the wasp some of its
                                         developing seeds, as food for the developing wasp larvae.
                                              Orchids show a bewildering diversity of floral
                                         patterns many of which have evolved to attract the right
                                         pollinator insect (bees and bumblebees) and ensure
                                         guaranteed pollination by it (Figure 11.5). Not all
                                         orchids offer rewards. The Mediterranean orchid Ophrys
                                         employs ‘sexual deceit’ to get pollination done by a
                                         species of bee. One petal of its flower bears an uncanny
                                         resemblance to the female of the bee in size, colour and
                                         markings. The male bee is attracted to what it perceives
                                         as a female, ‘pseudocopulates’ with the flower, and
                                         during that process is dusted with pollen from the
                                         flower. When this same bee ‘pseudocopulates’ with
 Figure 11.5 Showing bee-a pollinator
             on orchid flower            another flower, it transfers pollen to it and thus,
                                         pollinates the flower. Here you can see how co-evolution
                      operates. If the female bee’s colour patterns change even slightly for any
                      reason during evolution, pollination success will be reduced unless the
                      orchid flower co-evolves to maintain the resemblance of its petal to the
202                   female bee.

ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS




                                SUMMARY
    As a branch of biology, Ecology is the study of the relationships of
    living organisms with the abiotic (physico-chemical factors) and biotic
    components (other species) of their environment. It is concerned
    with four levels of biological organisation-organisms, populations,
    communities and biomes.
         Evolutionary changes through natural selection take place at
    the population level and hence, population ecology is an important
    area of ecology. A population is a group of individuals of a given
    species sharing or competing for similar resources in a defined
    geographical area. Populations have attributes that individual
    organisms do not- birth rates and death rates, sex ratio and age
    distribution. The proportion of different age groups of males and
    females in a population is often presented graphically as age
    pyramid; its shape indicates whether a population is stationary,
    growing or declining.
         Ecological effects of any factors on a population are generally
    reflected in its size (population density), which may be expressed in
    different ways (numbers, biomass, per cent cover, etc.,) depending
    on the species.
         Populations grow through births and immigration and decline
    through deaths and emigration. When resources are unlimited,
    the growth is usually exponential but when resources become
    progressively limiting, the growth pattern turns logistic. In either
    case, growth is ultimately limited by the carrying capacity of the
    environment. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) is a measure
    of the inherent potential of a population to grow.
         In nature populations of different species in a habitat do not live
    in isolation but interact in many ways. Depending on the outcome,
    these interactions between two species are classified as competition
    (both species suffer), predation and parasitism (one benefits and
    the other suffers), commensalism (one benefits and the other is
    unaffected), amensalism (one is harmed, other unaffected) and
    mutualism (both species benefit). Predation is a very important
    process through which trophic energy transfer is facilitated and
    some predators help in controlling their prey populations. Plants
    have evolved diverse morphological and chemical defenses against
    herbivory. In competition, it is presumed that the superior
    competitor eliminates the inferior one (the Competitive Exclusion
    Principle), but many closely related species have evolved various
    mechanisms which facilitate their co-existence. Some of the most
    fascinating cases of mutualism in nature are seen in plant-pollinator
                                                                               203
    interactions.

ECOSYSTEM


12.1 Ecosystem–Structure
     and Function
                                  An ecosystem can be visualised as a functional unit of
12.2. Productivity                nature, where living organisms interact among themselves
                                  and also with the surrounding physical environment.
12.3 Decomposition                Ecosystem varies greatly in size from a small pond to a
                                  large forest or a sea. Many ecologists regard the entire
12.4 Energy Flow                  biosphere as a global ecosystem, as a composite of all
                                  local ecosystems on Earth. Since this system is too much
12.5 Ecological Pyramids
                                  big and complex to be studied at one time, it is convenient
                                  to divide it into two basic categories, namely the
                                  terrestrial and the aquatic. Forest, grassland and desert
                                  are some examples of terrestrial ecosystems; pond, lake,
                                  wetland, river and estuary are some examples of aquatic
                                  ecosystems. Crop fields and an aquarium may also be
                                  considered as man-made ecosystems.
                                      We will first look at the structure of the ecosystem, in
                                  order to appreciate the input (productivity), transfer of
                                  energy (food chain/web, nutrient cycling) and the output
                                  (degradation and energy loss). We will also look at the
                                  relationships – cycles, chains, webs – that are created as
                                  a result of these energy flows within the system and their
                                  inter- relationship.

                12.1 ECOSYSTEM – STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
                In earlier classes, you have looked at the various components of the
                environment- abiotic and biotic. You studied how the individual biotic
                and abiotic factors affected each other and their surrounding. Let us look
                at these components in a more integrated manner and see how the flow of
                energy takes place within these components of the ecosystem.
                     Interaction of biotic and abiotic components result in a physical
                structure that is characteristic for each type of ecosystem. Identification
                and enumeration of plant and animal species of an ecosystem gives its
                species composition. Vertical distribution of different species occupying
                different levels is called stratification. For example, trees occupy top
                vertical strata or layer of a forest, shrubs the second and herbs and grasses
                occupy the bottom layers.
                     The components of the ecosystem are seen to function as a unit when
                you consider the following aspects:
                     (i) Productivity;
                    (ii) Decomposition;
                   (iii) Energy flow; and
                   (iv) Nutrient cycling.
                     To understand the ethos of an aquatic ecosystem let us take a small
                pond as an example. This is fairly a self-sustainable unit and rather simple
                example that explain even the complex interactions that exist in an aquatic
                ecosystem. A pond is a shallow water body in which all the above
                mentioned four basic components of an ecosystem are well exhibited.
                The abiotic component is the water with all the dissolved inorganic and
                organic substances and the rich soil deposit at the bottom of the pond.
                The solar input, the cycle of temperature, day-length and other climatic
                conditions regulate the rate of function of the entire pond. The autotrophic
                components include the phytoplankton, some algae and the floating,
                submerged and marginal plants found at the edges. The consumers are
                represented by the zooplankton, the free swimming and bottom dwelling
                forms. The decomposers are the fungi, bacteria and flagellates especially
                abundant in the bottom of the pond. This system performs all the functions
                of any ecosystem and of the biosphere as a whole, i.e., conversion of
                inorganic into organic material with the help of the radiant energy of the
                sun by the autotrophs; consumption of the autotrophs by heterotrophs;
                decomposition and mineralisation of the dead matter to release them back
                for reuse by the autotrophs, these event are repeated over and over again.
206             There is unidirectional movement of energy towards the higher trophic
                levels and its dissipation and loss as heat to the environment.

                12.2 PRODUCTIVITY
                A constant input of solar energy is the basic requirement for any ecosystem
                to function and sustain. Primary production is defined as the amount of

ECOSYSTEM


biomass or organic matter produced per unit area over a time period by
plants during photosynthesis. It is expressed in terms of weight (g m–2) or
energy (kcal m–2). The rate of biomass production is called productivity.
It is expressed in terms of gm–2 yr –1 or (kcal m –2) yr –1 to compare the
productivity of different ecosystems. It can be divided into gross primary
productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP). Gross primary
productivity of an ecosystem is the rate of production of organic matter
during photosynthesis. A considerable amount of GPP is utilised by plants
in respiration. Gross primary productivity minus respiration losses (R),
is the net primary productivity (NPP).
                                 GPP – R = NPP
     Net primary productivity is the available biomass for the consumption
to heterotrophs (herbiviores and decomposers). Secondary productivity
is defined as the rate of formation of new organic matter by
consumers.
     Primary productivity depends on the plant species inhabiting a
particular area. It also depends on a variety of environmental factors,
availability of nutrients and photosynthetic capacity of plants. Therefore,
it varies in different types of ecosystems. The annual net primary
productivity of the whole biosphere is approximately 170 billion tons
(dry weight) of organic matter. Of this, despite occupying about 70 per
cent of the surface, the productivity of the oceans are only 55 billion tons.
Rest of course, is on land. Discuss the main reason for the low
productivity of ocean with your teacher.

12.3 DECOMPOSITION
You may have heard of the earthworm being referred to as the farmer’s
‘friend’. This is so because they help in the breakdown of complex organic
matter as well as in loosening of the soil. Similarly, decomposers break
down complex organic matter into inorganic substances like carbon
dioxide, water and nutrients and the process is called decomposition.
Dead plant remains such as leaves, bark, flowers and dead remains of
animals, including fecal matter, constitute detritus, which is the raw
material for decomposition. The important steps in the process of
decomposition are fragmentation, leaching, catabolism, humification and
mineralisation.
     Detritivores (e.g., earthworm) break down detritus into smaller particles.
This process is called fragmentation. By the process of leaching, water-
soluble inorganic nutrients go down into the soil horizon and get precipitated    207
as unavailable salts. Bacterial and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into
simpler inorganic substances. This process is called as catabolism.
     It is important to note that all the above steps in decomposition operate
simultaneously on the detritus (Figure 12.1). Humification and
mineralisation occur during decomposition in the soil. Humification leads

                     to accumulation of a dark coloured amorphous substance called humus
                     that is highly resistant to microbial action and undergoes decomposition
                     at an extremely slow rate. Being colloidal in nature it serves as a reservoir
                     of nutrients. The humus is further degraded by some microbes and release
                     of inorganic nutrients occur by the process known as mineralisation.
                         Decomposition is largely an oxygen-requiring process. The rate of
                     decomposition is controlled by chemical composition of detritus and
                     climatic factors. In a particular climatic condition, decomposition rate
                     is slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin, and quicker, if detritus is
208                  rich in nitrogen and water-soluble substances like sugars. Temperature
                     and soil moisture are the most important climatic factors that regulate
                     decomposition through their effects on the activities of soil microbes.
                     Warm and moist environment favour decomposition whereas low
                     temperature and anaerobiosis inhibit decomposition resulting in build
                     up of organic materials.

Except for the deep sea hydro-thermal ecosystem, sun is the only source
of energy for all ecosystems on Earth. Of the incident solar radiation less
than 50 per cent of it is photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). We
know that plants and photosynthetic bacteria (autotrophs), fix Sun’s
radiant energy to make food from simple inorganic materials. Plants
capture only 2-10 per cent of the PAR and this small amount of energy
sustains the entire living world. So, it is very important to know how the
solar energy captured by plants flows through different organisms of an
ecosystem. All organisms are dependent for their food on producers, either
directly or indirectly. So you find unidirectional flow of energy from the
sun to producers and then to consumers. Is this in keeping with the first
law of thermodynamics?
     Further, ecosystems are not exempt from the Second Law of
thermodynamics. They need a constant supply of energy to synthesise
the molecules they require, to counteract the universal tendency toward
increasing disorderliness.
     The green plant in the ecosystem are called producers. In a terrestrial
ecosystem, major producers are herbaceous and woody plants. Likewise,
producers in an aquatic ecosystem are various species like phytoplankton,
algae and higher plants.
     You have read about the food chains and webs that exist in nature.
Starting from the plants (or producers) food chains or rather webs are
formed such that an animal feeds on a plant or on another animal and in
turn is food for another. The chain or web is formed because of this
interdependency. No energy that is trapped into an organism remains in
it for ever. The energy trapped by the producer, hence, is either passed on
to a consumer or the organism dies. Death of organism is the beginning
of the detritus food chain/web.
     All animals depend on plants (directly or indirectly) for their food needs.
They are hence called consumers and also heterotrophs. If they feed on
the producers, the plants, they are called primary consumers, and if the
animals eat other animals which in turn eat the plants (or their produce)
they are called secondary consumers. Likewise, you could have tertiary
consumers too. Obviously the primary consumers will be herbivores.
Some common herbivores are insects, birds and mammals in terrestrial
ecosystem and molluscs in aquatic ecosystem.
     The consumers that feed on these herbivores are carnivores, or more
correctly primary carnivores (though secondary consumers). Those                   209
animals that depend on the primary carnivores for food are labelled
secondary carnivores. A simple grazing food chain (GFC) is depicted
below:

                     The detritus food chain (DFC) begins with dead organic matter. It is
                 made up of decomposers which are heterotrophic organisms, mainly
                 fungi and bacteria. They meet their energy and nutrient requirements by
                 degrading dead organic matter or detritus. These are also known as
                 saprotrophs (sapro: to decompose). Decomposers secrete digestive
                 enzymes that breakdown dead and waste materials into simple, inorganic
                 materials, which are subsequently absorbed by them.
                     In an aquatic ecosystem, GFC is the major conduit for energy flow.
                 As against this, in a terrestrial ecosystem, a much larger fraction of energy
                 flows through the detritus food chain than through the GFC. Detritus
                 food chain may be connected with the grazing food chain at some levels:
                 some of the organisms of DFC are prey to the GFC animals, and in a natural
                 ecosystem, some animals like cockroaches, crows, etc., are omnivores.
                 These natural interconnection of food chains make it a food web. How
                 would you classify human beings!
                     Organisms occupy a place in the natural surroundings or in a
                 community according to their feeding relationship with other organisms.
                 Based on the source of their nutrition or food, organisms occupy a specific
                 place in the food chain that is known as their trophic level. Producers
                 belong to the first trophic level, herbivores (primary consumer) to the
                 second and carnivores (secondary consumer) to the third (Figure 12.2).

ECOSYSTEM


    The important point to note is that the amount of energy decreases at
successive trophic levels. When any organism dies it is converted to
detritus or dead biomass that serves as an energy source for decomposers.
Organisms at each trophic level depend on those at the lower trophic level
for their energy demands.
    Each trophic level has a certain mass of living material at a particular
time called as the standing crop. The standing crop is measured as the
mass of living organisms (biomass) or the number in a unit area. The
biomass of a species is expressed in terms of fresh or dry weight.
Measurement of biomass in terms of dry weight is more accurate. Why?
    The number of trophic levels in the grazing food chain is restricted as
the transfer of energy follows 10 per cent law – only 10 per cent of the
energy is transferred to each trophic level from the lower trophic level. In
nature, it is possible to have so many levels – producer, herbivore, primary
carnivore, secondary carnivore in the grazing food chain (Figure 12.3) .
Do you think there is any such limitation in a detritus food chain?

12.5 ECOLOGICAL PYRAMIDS
You must be familiar with the shape of a pyramid. The base of a pyramid
is broad and it narrows towards the apex. One gets a similar shape,
whether you express the food or energy relationship between organisms

                      at different trophic levels. This, relationship is expressed in terms of
                      number, biomass or energy. The base of each pyramid represents the
                      producers or the first trophic level while the apex represents tertiary or
                      top level consumer. The three types of ecological pyramids that are usually
                      studied are (a) pyramid of number; (b) pyramid of biomass and (c) pyramid
                      of energy. For detail (see Figure 12.4 a, b, c and d).

    Any calculations of energy content, biomass or numbers, has to include
all organisms at that trophic level. No generalisations we make will be
true if we take only a few individuals at any trophic level into account.
Also a given organism may occupy more than one trophic level
simultaneously. One must remember that the trophic level represents a
functional level, not a species as such. A given species may occupy more
than one trophic level in the same ecosystem at the same time; for example,
a sparrow is a primary consumer when it eats seeds, fruits, peas, and a
secondary consumer when it eats insects and worms. Can you work out
how many trophic levels human beings function at in a food chain?
    In most ecosystems, all the pyramids, of number, of energy and
biomass are upright, i.e., producers are more in number and biomass
than the herbivores, and herbivores are more in number and biomass
than the carnivores. Also energy at a lower trophic level is always more
than at a higher level.
    There are exceptions to this generalisation: If you were to count the
number of insects feeding on a big tree what kind of pyramid would you
get? Now add an estimate of the number of small birds depending on the
insects, as also the number of larger birds eating the smaller. Draw the
shape you would get.
    The pyramid of biomass in sea is generally inverted because the
biomass of fishes far exceeds that of phytoplankton. Isn’t that a paradox?
How would you explain this?
                                                                                          213
    Pyramid of energy is always upright, can never be inverted, because
when energy flows from a particular trophic level to the next trophic level,
some energy is always lost as heat at each step. Each bar in the energy
pyramid indicates the amount of energy present at each trophic level in a
given time or annually per unit area.

                    However, there are certain limitations of ecological pyramids such as
                it does not take into account the same species belonging to two or more
                trophic levels. It assumes a simple food chain, something that almost
                never exists in nature; it does not accommodate a food web. Moreover,
                saprophytes are not given any place in ecological pyramids even though
                they play a vital role in the ecosystem.


                                                 SUMMARY
                  An ecosystem is a structural and functional unit of nature and it
                  comprises abiotic and biotic components. Abiotic components are
                  inorganic materials- air, water and soil, whereas biotic components
                  are producers, consumers and decomposers. Each ecosystem has
                  characteristic physical structure resulting from interaction amongst
                  abiotic and biotic components. Species composition and stratification
                  are the two main structural features of an ecosystem. Based on source
                  of nutrition every organism occupies a place in an ecosystem.
                      Productivity, decomposition, energy flow, and nutrient cycling are
                  the four important components of an ecosystem. Primary productivity
                  is the rate of capture of solar energy or biomass production of the
                  producers. It is divided into two types: gross primary productivity (GPP)
                  and net primary productivity (NPP). Rate of capture of solar energy or
                  total production of organic matter is called as GPP. NPP is the remaining
                  biomass or the energy left after utilisation of producers. Secondary
                  productivity is the rate of assimilation of food energy by the consumers.
                  In decomposition, complex organic compounds of detritus are converted
                  to carbon dioxide, water and inorganic nutrients by the decomposers.
                  Decomposition involves three processes, namely fragmentation of
                  detritus, leaching and catabolism.
                      Energy flow is unidirectional. First, plants capture solar energy
                  and then, food is transferred from the producers to decomposers.
                  Organisms of different trophic levels in nature are connected to each
                  other for food or energy relationship forming a food chain. The storage
                  and movement of nutrient elements through the various components
                  of the ecosystem is called nutrient cycling; nutrients are repeatedly
                  used through this process. Nutrient cycling is of two types—gaseous
                  and sedimentary. Atmosphere or hydrosphere is the reservoir for the
                  gaseous type of cycle (carbon), whereas Earth’s crust is the reservoir
                  for sedimentary type (phosphorus). Products of ecosystem processes
                  are named as ecosystem services, e.g., purification of air and water by
                  forests.

                                  would most probably be the enormous diversity of life
                                  that he would encounter. Even for humans, the rich variety
                                  of living organisms with which they share this planet never
                                  ceases to astonish and fascinate us. The common man
                                  would find it hard to believe that there are more than
                                  20,000 species of ants, 3,00,000 species of beetles, 28,000
                                  species of fishes and nearly 20,000 species of orchids.
                                  Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have been trying
                                  to understand the significance of such diversity by asking
                                  important questions– Why are there so many species?
                                  Did such great diversity exist throughout earth’s history?
                                  How did this diversification come about? How and why
                                  is this diversity important to the biosphere? Would it
                                  function any differently if the diversity was much less?
                                  How do humans benefit from the diversity of life?

combined diversity at all the levels of biological organisation.
The most important of them are–
  (i) Genetic diversity : A single species might show high diversity at
      the genetic level over its distributional range. The genetic variation
      shown by the medicinal plant Rauwolfia vomitoria growing in
      different Himalayan ranges might be in terms of the potency and
      concentration of the active chemical (reserpine) that the plant
      produces. India has more than 50,000 genetically different strains
      of rice, and 1,000 varieties of mango.
 (ii) Species diversity : The diversity at the species level, for example,
      the Western Ghats have a greater amphibian species diversity than
      the Eastern Ghats.
 (iii) Ecological diversity : At the ecosystem level, India, for instance,
       with its deserts, rain forests, mangroves, coral reefs, wetlands,
       estuaries, and alpine meadows has a greater ecosystem diversity
       than a Scandinavian country like Norway.
     It has taken millions of years of evolution, to accumulate this rich
diversity in nature, but we could lose all that wealth in less than two
centuries if the present rates of species losses continue. Biodiversity and
its conservation are now vital environmental issues of international concern
as more and more people around the world begin to realise the critical
importance of biodiversity for our survival and well- being on this planet.

13.1.1 How Many Species are there on Earth and How Many
       in India?
Since there are published records of all the species discovered and named,
we know how many species in all have been recorded so far, but it is not
easy to answer the question of how many species there are on earth.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and
Natural Resources (IUCN) (2004), the total number of plant and animal
species described so far is slightly more than 1.5 million, but we have no
clear idea of how many species are yet to be discovered and described.
Estimates vary widely and many of them are only educated guesses. For
many taxonomic groups, species inventories are more complete in
temperate than in tropical countries. Considering that an overwhelmingly
large proportion of the species waiting to be discovered are in the tropics,
biologists make a statistical comparison of the temperate-tropical species
                                                                               217
richness of an exhaustively studied group of insects and extrapolate this
ratio to other groups of animals and plants to come up with a gross
estimate of the total number of species on earth. Some extreme estimates
range from 20 to 50 million, but a more conservative and scientifically
sound estimate made by Robert May places the global species diversity
at about 7 million.

                     Let us look at some interesting aspects about earth’s biodiversity based
                on the currently available species inventories. More than 70 per cent of
                all the species recorded are animals, while plants (including algae, fungi,
                bryophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms) comprise no more than 22
                per cent of the total. Among animals, insects are the most species-rich
                taxonomic group, making up more than 70 per cent of the total. That
                means, out of every 10 animals on this planet, 7 are insects. Again, how
                do we explain this enormous diversification of insects? The number of
                fungi species in the world is more than the combined total of the species
                of fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. In Figure 13.1, biodiversity
                is depicted showing species number of major taxa.

                    It should be noted that these estimates do not give any figures for
218
                prokaryotes. Biologists are not sure about how many prokaryotic species
                there might be. The problem is that conventional taxonomic methods are
                not suitable for identifying microbial species and many species are simply
                not culturable under laboratory conditions. If we accept biochemical or
                molecular criteria for delineating species for this group, then their diversity
                alone might run into millions.

BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION


    Although India has only 2.4 per cent of the world’s land area, its share
of the global species diversity is an impressive 8.1 per cent. That is what
makes our country one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world.
Nearly 45,000 species of plants and twice as many of animals have been
recorded from India. How many living species are actually there waiting
to be discovered and named? If we accept May’s global estimates, only
22 per cent of the total species have been recorded so far. Applying this
proportion to India’s diversity figures, we estimate that there are probably
more than 1,00,000 plant species and more than 3,00,000 animal species
yet to be discovered and described. Would we ever be able to complete
the inventory of the biological wealth of our country? Consider the immense
trained manpower (taxonomists) and the time required to complete the
job. The situation appears more hopeless when we realise that a large
fraction of these species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before
we discover them. Nature’s biological library is burning even before we
catalogued the titles of all the books stocked there.

13.1.2 Patterns of Biodiversity
  (i) Latitudinal gradients : The diversity of plants and animals is
      not uniform throughout the world but shows a rather uneven
      distribution. For many group of animals or plants, there are
      interesting patterns in diversity, the most well- known being the
      latitudinal gradient in diversity. In general, species diversity
      decreases as we move away from the equator towards the poles.
      With very few exceptions, tropics (latitudinal range of 23.5° N to
      23.5° S) harbour more species than temperate or polar areas.
      Colombia located near the equator has nearly 1,400 species of birds
      while New York at 41° N has 105 species and Greenland at 71° N
      only 56 species. India, with much of its land area in the tropical
      latitudes, has more than 1,200 species of birds. A forest in a tropical
      region like Equador has up to 10 times as many species of vascular
      plants as a forest of equal area in a temperate region like the Midwest
      of the USA. The largely tropical Amazonian rain forest in South
      America has the greatest biodiversity on earth- it is home to more
      than 40,000 species of plants, 3,000 of fishes, 1,300 of birds, 427
      of mammals, 427 of amphibians, 378 of reptiles and of more than
      1,25,000 invertebrates. Scientists estimate that in these rain forests
      there might be at least two million insect species waiting to be
      discovered and named.
      What is so special about tropics that might account for their greater
                                                                                219
      biological diversity? Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have
      proposed various hypotheses; some important ones are (a) Speciation
      is generally a function of time, unlike temperate regions subjected
      to frequent glaciations in the past, tropical latitudes have remained
      relatively undisturbed for millions of years and thus, had a long

                             evolutionary time for species diversification, (b) Tropical environments,
                             unlike temperate ones, are less seasonal, relatively more constant
                             and predictable. Such constant environments promote niche
                             specialisation and lead to a greater species diversity and (c) There
                             is more solar energy available in the tropics, which contributes to
                             higher productivity; this in turn might contribute indirectly to greater
                             diversity.
                        (ii) Species-Area relationships : During his pioneering and extensive
                             explorations in the wilderness of South American jungles, the great
                             German naturalist and geographer Alexander von Humboldt
                                                           observed that within a region species
                                                           richness increased with increasing
                                                           explored area, but only up to a limit. In
                                                           fact, the relation between species richness
                                                           and area for a wide variety of taxa
                                                           (angiosperm plants, birds, bats,

                                                           value of Z lies in the range of 0.1 to 0.2,
             Note that on log scale the relationship
             becomes linear                                regardless of the taxonomic group or the

                      birds in California or molluscs in New York state, the slopes of the regression
                      line are amazingly similar). But, if you analyse the species-area
                      relationships among very large areas like the entire continents, you will
                      find that the slope of the line to be much steeper (Z values in the range
                      of 0.6 to 1.2). For example, for frugivorous (fruit-eating) birds and
                      mammals in the tropical forests of different continents, the slope is found
                      to be 1.15. What do steeper slopes mean in this context?

220                     13.1.3 The importance of Species Diversity to the Ecosystem
                        Does the number of species in a community really matter to the functioning
                        of the ecosystem?This is a question for which ecologists have not been
                        able to give a definitive answer. For many decades, ecologists believed
                        that communities with more species, generally, tend to be more stable
                        than those with less species. What exactly is stability for a biological

community? A stable community should not show too much variation
in productivity from year to year; it must be either resistant or resilient to
occasional disturbances (natural or man-made), and it must also be
resistant to invasions by alien species. We don’t know how these attributes
are linked to species richness in a community, but David Tilman’s
long-term ecosystem experiments using outdoor plots provide some
tentative answers. Tilman found that plots with more species showed
less year-to-year variation in total biomass. He also showed that in his
experiments, increased diversity contributed to higher productivity.
    Although, we may not understand completely how species richness
contributes to the well-being of an ecosystem, we know enough to realise
that rich biodiversity is not only essential for ecosystem health but
imperative for the very survival of the human race on this planet. At a
time when we are losing species at an alarming pace, one might ask–
Does it really matter to us if a few species become extinct? Would Western
Ghats ecosystems be less functional if one of its tree frog species is lost
forever? How is our quality of life affected if, say, instead of 20,000 we
have only 15,000 species of ants on earth?
    There are no direct answers to such näive questions but we can develop
a proper perspective through an analogy (the ‘rivet popper hypothesis’)
used by Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich. In an airplane (ecosystem) all
parts are joined together using thousands of rivets (species). If every
passenger travelling in it starts popping a rivet to take home (causing a
species to become extinct), it may not affect flight safety (proper functioning
of the ecosystem) initially, but as more and more rivets are removed, the
plane becomes dangerously weak over a period of time. Furthermore,
which rivet is removed may also be critical. Loss of rivets on the wings
(key species that drive major ecosystem functions) is obviously a more
serious threat to flight safety than loss of a few rivets on the seats or
windows inside the plane.

13.1.4 Loss of Biodiversity
While it is doubtful if any new species are being added (through speciation)
into the earth’s treasury of species, there is no doubt about their continuing
losses. The biological wealth of our planet has been declining rapidly
and the accusing finger is clearly pointing to human activities. The
colonisation of tropical Pacific Islands by humans is said to have led to
the extinction of more than 2,000 species of native birds. The IUCN Red
List (2004) documents the extinction of 784 species (including 338                221
vertebrates, 359 invertebrates and 87 plants) in the last 500 years. Some
examples of recent extinctions include the dodo (Mauritius), quagga
(Africa), thylacine (Australia), Steller’s Sea Cow (Russia) and three
subspecies (Bali, Javan, Caspian) of tiger. The last twenty years alone
have witnessed the disappearance of 27 species. Careful analysis of records

                                                                                      BIOLOGY


                shows that extinctions across taxa are not random; some groups like
                amphibians appear to be more vulnerable to extinction. Adding to the
                grim scenario of extinctions is the fact that more than 15,500 species
                world-wide are facing the threat of extinction. Presently, 12 per cent of
                all bird species, 23 per cent of all mammal species, 32 per cent of all
                amphibian species and 31per cent of all gymnosperm species in the world
                face the threat of extinction.
                     From a study of the history of life on earth through fossil records, we
                learn that large-scale loss of species like the one we are currently
                witnessing have also happened earlier, even before humans appeared on
                the scene. During the long period (> 3 billion years) since the origin and
                diversification of life on earth there were five episodes of mass extinction
                of species. How is the ‘Sixth Extinction’ presently in progress different
                from the previous episodes? The difference is in the rates; the current
                species extinction rates are estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times faster
                than in the pre-human times and our activities are responsible for the
                faster rates. Ecologists warn that if the present trends continue,
                nearly half of all the species on earth might be wiped out within the next
                100 years.
                     In general, loss of biodiversity in a region may lead to (a) decline in
                plant production, (b) lowered resistance to environmental perturbations
                such as drought and (c) increased variability in certain ecosystem processes
                such as plant productivity, water use, and pest and disease cycles.
                Causes of biodiversity losses: The accelerated rates of species
                extinctions that the world is facing now are largely due to human
                activities. There are four major causes (‘ The Evil Quartet ’ is the sobriquet
                used to describe them).
                   (i) Habitat loss and fragmentation: This is the most important
                       cause driving animals and plants to extinction. The most dramatic
                       examples of habitat loss come from tropical rain forests. Once
                       covering more than 14 per cent of the earth’s land surface, these
                       rain forests now cover no more than 6 per cent. They are being
                       destroyed fast. By the time you finish reading this chapter, 1000
                       more hectares of rain forest would have been lost. The Amazon
                       rain forest (it is so huge that it is called the ‘lungs of the planet’)
                       harbouring probably millions of species is being cut and cleared
                       for cultivating soya beans or for conversion to grasslands for raising
                       beef cattle. Besides total loss, the degradation of many habitats by
222                    pollution also threatens the survival of many species. When large
                       habitats are broken up into small fragments due to various human
                       activities, mammals and birds requiring large territories and certain
                       animals with migratory habits are badly affected, leading to
                       population declines.
                  (ii) Over-exploitation: Humans have always depended on nature for
                       food and shelter, but when ‘need’ turns to ‘greed’, it leads to

BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION


       over -exploitation of natural resources. Many species extinctions
       in the last 500 years (Steller’s sea cow, passenger pigeon) were due
       to overexploitation by humans. Presently many marine fish
       populations around the world are over harvested, endangering the
       continued existence of some commercially important species.
 (iii) Alien species invasions: When alien species are introduced
       unintentionally or deliberately for whatever purpose, some of them
       turn invasive, and cause decline or extinction of indigenous species.
       The Nile perch introduced into Lake Victoria in east Africa led
       eventually to the extinction of an ecologically unique assemblage of
       more than 200 species of cichlid fish in the lake. You must be
       familiar with the environmental damage caused and threat posed
       to our native species by invasive weed species like carrot grass
       (Parthenium), Lantana and water hyacinth (Eicchornia). The recent
       illegal introduction of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus for
       aquaculture purposes is posing a threat to the indigenous catfishes
       in our rivers.
 (iv) Co-extinctions: When a species becomes extinct, the plant and
       animal species associated with it in an obligatory way also become
       extinct. When a host fish species becomes extinct, its unique
       assemblage of parasites also meets the same fate. Another example
       is the case of a coevolved plant-pollinator mutualism where
       extinction of one invariably leads to the extinction of the other.

13.2 BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION
13.2.1 Why Should We Conserve Biodiversity?
There are many reasons, some obvious and others not so obvious, but all
equally important. They can be grouped into three categories: narrowly
utilitarian, broadly utilitarian, and ethical.
    The narrowly utilitarian arguments for conserving biodiversity are
obvious; humans derive countless direct economic benefits from nature-
food (cereals, pulses, fruits), firewood, fibre, construction material,
industrial products (tannins, lubricants, dyes, resins, perfumes ) and
products of medicinal importance. More than 25 per cent of the drugs
currently sold in the market worldwide are derived from plants and 25,000
species of plants contribute to the traditional medicines used by native
peoples around the world. Nobody knows how many more medicinally
useful plants there are in tropical rain forests waiting to be explored.
                                                                               223
With increasing resources put into ‘bioprospecting’ (exploring molecular,
genetic and species-level diversity for products of economic importance),
nations endowed with rich biodiversity can expect to reap enormous
benefits.
    The broadly utilitarian argument says that biodiversity plays a
major role in many ecosystem services that nature provides. The fast-

                dwindling Amazon forest is estimated to produce, through
                photosynthesis, 20 per cent of the total oxygen in the earth’s atmosphere.
                Can we put an economic value on this service by nature? You can get
                some idea by finding out how much your neighborhood hospital spends
                on a cylinder of oxygen. Pollination (without which plants cannot give
                us fruits or seeds) is another service, ecosystems provide through
                pollinators layer – bees, bumblebees, birds and bats. What will be the
                costs of accomplishing pollination without help from natural
                pollinators? There are other intangible benefits – that we derive from
                nature–the aesthetic pleasures of walking through thick woods, watching
                spring flowers in full bloom or waking up to a bulbul’s song in the
                morning. Can we put a price tag on such things?
                    The ethical argument for conserving biodiversity relates to what we
                owe to millions of plant, animal and microbe species with whom we share
                this planet. Philosophically or spiritually, we need to realise that every
                species has an intrinsic value, even if it may not be of current or any
                economic value to us. We have a moral duty to care for their well-being
                and pass on our biological legacy in good order to future generations.

                13.2.2 How do we conserve Biodiversity?
                When we conserve and protect the whole ecosystem, its biodiversity at all
                levels is protected - we save the entire forest to save the tiger. This approach
                is called in situ (on site) conservation. However, when there are situations
                where an animal or plant is endangered or threatened (organisms facing
                a very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future) and needs
                urgent measures to save it from extinction, ex situ (off site) conservation
                is the desirable approach.
                In situ conservation– Faced with the conflict between development and
                conservation, many nations find it unrealistic and economically not feasible
                to conserve all their biological wealth. Invariably, the number of species
                waiting to be saved from extinction far exceeds the conservation resources
                available. On a global basis, this problem has been addressed by eminent
                conservationists. They identified for maximum protection certain
                ‘biodiversity hotspots’ regions with very high levels of species richness
                and high degree of endemism (that is, species confined to that region
                and not found anywhere else). Initially 25 biodiversity hotspots were
                identified but subsequently nine more have been added to the list,
                bringing the total number of biodiversity hotspots in the world to 34.
224             These hotspots are also regions of accelerated habitat loss. Three of
                these hotspots – Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, Indo-Burma and
                Himalaya – cover our country’s exceptionally high biodiversity regions.
                Although all the biodiversity hotspots put together cover less than
                2 per cent of the earth’s land area, the number of species they collectively

BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION


harbour is extremely high and strict protection of these hotspots could
reduce the ongoing mass extinctions by almost 30 per cent.
    In India, ecologically unique and biodiversity-rich regions are legally
protected as biosphere reserves, national parks and sanctuaries. India
now has 14 biosphere reserves, 90 national parks and 448 wildlife
sanctuaries. India has also a history of religious and cultural traditions
that emphasised protection of nature. In many cultures, tracts of forest
were set aside, and all the trees and wildlife within were venerated and
given total protection. Such sacred groves are found in Khasi and Jaintia
Hills in Meghalaya, Aravalli Hills of Rajasthan, Western Ghat regions of
Karnataka and Maharashtra and the Sarguja, Chanda and Bastar areas
of Madhya Pradesh. In Meghalaya, the sacred groves are the last refuges
for a large number of rare and threatened plants.
Ex situ Conservation– In this approach, threatened animals and plants
are taken out from their natural habitat and placed in special setting
where they can be protected and given special care. Zoological parks,
botanical gardens and wildlife safari parks serve this purpose. There are
many animals that have become extinct in the wild but continue to be
maintained in zoological parks. In recent years ex situ conservation has
advanced beyond keeping threatened species in enclosures. Now gametes
of threatened species can be preserved in viable and fertile condition for
long periods using cryopreservation techniques, eggs can be fertilised in
vitro, and plants can be propagated using tissue culture methods. Seeds
of different genetic strains of commercially important plants can be kept
for long periods in seed banks.
    Biodiversity knows no political boundaries and its conservation is
therefore a collective responsibility of all nations. The historic Convention
on Biological Diversity (‘The Earth Summit’) held in Rio de Janeiro in
1992, called upon all nations to take appropriate measures for
conservation of biodiversity and sustainable utilisation of its benefits. In
a follow-up, the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in 2002
in Johannesburg, South Africa, 190 countries pledged their commitment
to achieve by 2010, a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity
loss at global, regional and local levels.

                                SUMMARY
   Since life originated on earth nearly 3.8 billion years ago, there had
   been enormous diversification of life forms on earth. Biodiversity refers
   to the sum total of diversity that exists at all levels of biological          225
   organisation. Of particular importance is the diversity at genetic, species
   and ecosystem levels and conservation efforts are aimed at protecting
   diversity at all these levels.
       More than 1.5 million species have been recorded in the world, but
   there might still be nearly 6 million species on earth waiting to be

                 discovered and named. Of the named species, > 70 per cent are animals,
                 of which 70 per cent are insects. The group Fungi has more species
                 than all the vertebrate species combined. India, with about 45,000
                 species of plants and twice as many species of animals, is one of the 12
                 mega diversity countries of the world.
                      Species diversity on earth is not uniformly distributed but shows
                 interesting patterns. It is generally highest in the tropics and decreases
                 towards the poles. Important explanations for the species richness of
                 the tropics are: Tropics had more evolutionary time; they provide a
                 relatively constant environment and, they receive more solar energy
                 which contributes to greater productivity. Species richness is also
                 function of the area of a region; the species-area relationship is generally
                 a rectangular hyperbolic function.
                      It is believed that communities with high diversity tend to be less
                 variable, more productive and more resistant to biological invasions.
                 Earth’s fossil history reveals incidence of mass extinctions in the past,
                 but the present rates of extinction, largely attributed to human activities,
                 are 100 to 1000 times higher. Nearly 700 species have become extinct
                 in recent times and more than 15,500 species (of which > 650 are from
                 India) currently face the threat of extinction. The causes of high
                 extinction rates at present include habitat (particularly forests) loss
                 and fragmentation, over -exploitation, biological invasions and
                 co- extinctions.
                      Earth’s rich biodiversity is vital for the very survival of mankind.
                 The reasons for conserving biodiversity are narrowly utilitarian, broadly
                 utilitarian and ethical. Besides the direct benefits (food, fibre, firewood,
                 pharmaceuticals, etc.), there are many indirect benefits we receive
                 through ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, climate
                 moderation and flood control. We also have a moral responsibility to
                 take good care of earth’s biodiversity and pass it on in good order to our
                 next generation.
                      Biodiversity conservation may be in situ as well as ex situ. In in situ
                 conservation, the endangered species are protected in their natural
                 habitat so that the entire ecosystem is protected. Recently, 34
                 ‘biodiversity hotspots’ in the world have been proposed for intensive
                 conservation ef forts. Of these, three (Wester n Ghats-Sri Lanka,
                 Himalaya and Indo-Burma) cover India’s rich biodiversity regions. Our
                 country’s in situ conservation efforts are reflected in its 14 biosphere
                 reserves, 90 national parks, > 450 wildlife sanctuaries and many sacred
                 groves. Ex situ conservation methods include protective maintenance
                 of threatened species in zoological parks and botanical gardens, in vitro
                 fertilisation, tissue culture propagation and cryopreservation of
                 gametes.
